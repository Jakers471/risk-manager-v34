# State Persistence Test Report

**Agent**: 5 - State Persistence Tests
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING (8/8)

---

## Executive Summary

Created comprehensive state persistence tests to verify that cooldowns, lockouts, and P&L survive database restarts. All 8 tests passing with no issues found.

**Key Finding**: The state management system properly persists all critical data across database close/reopen cycles.

## Tests Created

### 1. **test_cooldown_persists_across_restart**
**Purpose**: Verify cooldown timers survive database restart
**Scenario**:
- Set 300-second cooldown
- Close database connection
- Reopen database
- Verify cooldown still active with correct remaining time

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Output**:
```
Phase 1: Cooldown set, 299s remaining
Phase 2: Cooldown restored, 299s remaining
```

---

### 2. **test_hard_lockout_persists_with_until_time**
**Purpose**: Verify hard lockouts with absolute time persist
**Scenario**:
- Set hard lockout until 2 hours from now
- Close database
- Reopen database
- Verify lockout still active with correct expiry time

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Notes**: Hard lockouts use absolute datetime (not countdown), so they persist accurately.

---

### 3. **test_pnl_persists_across_restart**
**Purpose**: Verify daily P&L tracking survives restart
**Scenario**:
- Add trades: -$200, -$150 (total: -$350)
- Close database
- Reopen database
- Verify P&L still shows -$350

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Critical for**: Daily loss limits, P&L-based rules

---

### 4. **test_expired_lockout_not_restored**
**Purpose**: Verify expired lockouts are NOT restored after restart
**Scenario**:
- Set 1-second cooldown
- Wait 2 seconds (expires)
- Close database
- Reopen database
- Verify lockout is NOT active

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Notes**: `load_lockouts_from_db()` correctly filters expired lockouts with `WHERE expires_at > ?`

---

### 5. **test_multiple_accounts_persist_independently**
**Purpose**: Verify multiple accounts with different states persist correctly
**Scenario**:
- Account 1: Set cooldown
- Account 2: Set hard lockout
- Account 3: P&L only (no lockout)
- Close database
- Reopen database
- Verify all states persist independently

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Critical for**: Multi-account systems

---

### 6. **test_pnl_with_trade_count_persists**
**Purpose**: Verify both P&L amount and trade count persist
**Scenario**:
- Add 5 trades totaling -$100
- Close database
- Reopen database
- Verify both P&L (-$100) and trade count (5) persist

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Critical for**: Trade frequency limits

---

### 7. **test_lockout_details_persist_accurately**
**Purpose**: Verify lockout reason and type persist correctly
**Scenario**:
- Set cooldown with specific reason
- Close database
- Reopen database
- Verify reason string matches exactly

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Notes**: After restart, cooldowns become `hard_lockout` type (not `cooldown`) since timers don't persist.

---

### 8. **test_simultaneous_multiple_db_connections**
**Purpose**: Verify multiple DB connections can read/write simultaneously
**Scenario**:
- Open two independent DB connections
- Write from connection 1
- Read from connection 2 (should see change)
- Write from connection 2
- Read from connection 1 (should see update)

**Result**: ✅ PASSED
**Critical for**: Concurrent access patterns in production

## Code Coverage

```
Module                           Coverage   Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
database.py                      70.16%     Core persistence (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT)
lockout_manager.py               46.63%     Lockout persistence tested
pnl_tracker.py                   62.50%     P&L persistence tested
timer_manager.py                 67.77%     Timer infrastructure (used by tests)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall state persistence        47.69%     Critical paths covered
```

**Coverage Notes**:
- ✅ All critical persistence paths tested (save, load, close/reopen)
- ⚠️ Some helper methods not tested (reset_daily_pnl, get_all_daily_pnls)
- ⚠️ reset_scheduler.py only 11.80% (not tested yet, separate agent task)

---

## API Findings

### Database API
✅ **Works as expected**:
- `Database(db_path=str)` - Supports file paths and ":memory:"
- `db.close()` - Properly closes connections
- `db.execute()`, `db.execute_one()`, `db.execute_write()` - All work correctly

### LockoutManager API
⚠️ **Method name difference from task spec**:
- Task spec said: `is_account_locked()`
- Actual implementation: `is_locked_out()`

✅ **Persistence methods work correctly**:
- `set_cooldown(account_id, duration_seconds, reason)` - Persists to DB
- `set_lockout(account_id, reason, until)` - Persists to DB
- `load_lockouts_from_db()` - Auto-called on init, loads non-expired lockouts
- `get_lockout_info(account_id)` - Returns persisted details

**Important behavior**:
- Cooldowns set via `set_cooldown()` are restored as `hard_lockout` type after restart
- This is expected because `TimerManager` timers don't persist (in-memory only)
- The lockout remains enforced until expiry time, just without timer callback

### PnLTracker API
✅ **Works as expected**:
- `add_trade_pnl(account_id, pnl)` - Persists immediately
- `get_daily_pnl(account_id)` - Reads from DB
- `get_stats(account_id)` - Returns both P&L and trade count

---

## Database Schema Validation

Verified tables used for persistence:

### `lockouts` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE lockouts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    account_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    rule_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    locked_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    expires_at TEXT,              -- Used for persistence check
    unlock_condition TEXT,
    active INTEGER DEFAULT 1,     -- Used to mark expired
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(account_id, rule_id) ON CONFLICT REPLACE
)
```

**Load query** (from `load_lockouts_from_db()`):
```sql
SELECT account_id, reason, expires_at, locked_at
FROM lockouts
WHERE active = 1 AND expires_at > ?  -- Filters expired lockouts
```

### `daily_pnl` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_pnl (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    account_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    realized_pnl REAL DEFAULT 0.0,   -- Cumulative P&L
    trade_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,   -- Number of trades
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(account_id, date)
)
```

## Crash Recovery Behavior

### What Survives Restart
✅ **Lockout state**: Active lockouts with remaining time
✅ **P&L state**: Daily realized P&L and trade counts
✅ **Lockout reason**: Human-readable reason strings
✅ **Expiry times**: Absolute datetime for hard lockouts

### What Does NOT Survive Restart
❌ **Timer callbacks**: TimerManager is in-memory only
❌ **Cooldown type**: Becomes `hard_lockout` after restart
❌ **Expired lockouts**: Filtered out during `load_lockouts_from_db()`

### This is CORRECT Behavior
The system correctly:
1. Persists lockout enforcement (still locked out)
2. Does not persist expired lockouts (would be wasteful)
3. Converts cooldowns to hard lockouts (functionally equivalent)

---

## Production Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Production
- State persistence works correctly
- Expired lockouts properly filtered
- Multiple accounts supported
- Concurrent access works
- Crash recovery tested

### ⚠️ Considerations
1. **Timer callbacks lost on restart**: After restart, cooldowns won't trigger callbacks, but enforcement still works (lockout remains until expiry time)
2. **Type change**: Cooldowns become hard lockouts after restart (cosmetic, not functional issue)
3. **Database path**: Production should use absolute path, not ":memory:"

---

## Example Usage

```python
# Production setup
db = Database(db_path="data/risk_manager.db")
timer_mgr = TimerManager()
await timer_mgr.start()

lockout_mgr = LockoutManager(database=db, timer_manager=timer_mgr)
# ^ Automatically loads lockouts from DB on init

# Set cooldown
await lockout_mgr.set_cooldown(
    account_id=123,
    duration_seconds=1800,  # 30 minutes
    reason="Trade frequency limit exceeded"
)

# Even if service crashes and restarts:
# 1. DB persists the lockout with expires_at time
# 2. On restart, LockoutManager loads it from DB
# 3. Account stays locked until expires_at
```

---

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run state persistence tests
pytest tests/integration/test_state_persistence.py -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/integration/test_state_persistence.py --cov=src/risk_manager/state

# Expected: 8/8 passing, ~3 seconds
```

## Conclusion

✅ **State persistence system is production-ready**

All critical state (lockouts, cooldowns, P&L) survives database restarts correctly. The system properly filters expired lockouts and handles multiple accounts independently.

**No issues found during testing.**
