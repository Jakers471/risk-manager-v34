## üîç Key Discoveries

### 1. Risk Rules (13 Total)

**Found:**
- 12 fully specified rules (RULE-001 through RULE-012)
- 1 partially specified rule (RULE-013 mentioned but no dedicated spec)

**Categories:**
- Trade-by-Trade (6 rules): Close specific position, no lockout
- Timer/Cooldown (2 rules): Close all + temporary lockout
- Hard Lockout (4 rules): Close all + lockout until condition
- Automation (1 rule): Trade management (not enforcement)

**Conflicts Identified:**
- RULE-004, 005: Primary spec vs Categories doc (enforcement type mismatch)
- **Resolution:** Use Categories doc (more recent, explicitly states correction)

**Missing:**
- RULE-013 (Daily Realized Profit) needs dedicated specification file

**Status:** 2/13 implemented (15%)

---

## üìã Cross-Cutting Insights

### Version Analysis

**Old vs New Documentation:**

**Archived (Old):**
- `docs/archive/2025-10-23/` - Project structure, roadmap, session resume
- `docs/archive/2025-10-23-old-sessions/` - Previous session docs
- `docs/archive/2025-10-23-testing-docs/` - Consolidated testing docs (87% reduction)
- `docs/PROJECT_DOCS/` - **Original specifications (pre-SDK)** - Still valuable for design intent

**Current (Active):**
- `docs/current/` - Active design docs (SDK-first approach)
- `docs/testing/` - Consolidated testing guides (single source of truth)
- Root `*.md` files - SDK references, logging, test runner docs

**Key Insight:** Original PROJECT_DOCS specs were written BEFORE Project-X SDK existed. They describe manual API integration. Current implementation is SDK-first. Both have value:
- **PROJECT_DOCS:** Design intent, detailed specifications, edge cases
- **Current docs:** SDK-based implementation approach, integration patterns

### Conflicts Resolved

**1. Risk Rules:**
- RULE-004, 005 enforcement type conflicts ‚Üí Use Categories doc (newer)
- Missing RULE-013 spec ‚Üí Needs creation using RULE-003 as template

**2. SDK Integration:**
- Old API specs vs current SDK ‚Üí SDK approach is superior (93% code reduction)
- Manual WebSocket vs SDK auto-management ‚Üí Use SDK

**3. Architecture:**
- v1 vs v2 ‚Üí v2 is evolved production-ready design
- All v1‚Üív2 changes are refinements, not contradictions

**4. Testing:**
- 5 archived testing docs (175KB, 87% redundant) ‚Üí 3 focused guides (22KB)
- Single source of truth achieved

### Shared Infrastructure Needs

**Cross-Rule Dependencies:**
1. **State Persistence:** 4 SQLite tables (daily_pnl, lockouts, timers, trade_counts)
2. **Enforcement Modules:** MOD-001 to MOD-004
3. **SDK Integration:** Event bridge for 5+ event types
4. **Utilities:** Symbol extraction, timezone handling, logging
5. **Configuration:** YAML loader with Pydantic validation
