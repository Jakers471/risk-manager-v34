**Innovation - Adaptable Documentation:**
```markdown
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Adaptable Documentation

**This file uses REFERENCES, not hard-coded structures.**

- ❌ **DON'T** rely on cached file trees or progress percentages
- ✅ **DO** use paths and check actual files for current state
- ✅ **DO** use `ls`, `find`, `pytest --collect-only` to see structure
- ✅ **DO** read `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for latest progress
- ✅ **DO** check `test_reports/latest.txt` for most recent test results

**Reason**: Hard-coded structures go stale immediately. Always check the actual files.
```

**10-File Priority Reading List:**
```
Priority 1 - Project Status (2 min):
  1. docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md       - Current state & progress
  2. test_reports/latest.txt              - Most recent test results

Priority 2 - Testing System (3 min):
  3. docs/testing/README.md               - Testing navigation
  4. docs/testing/TESTING_GUIDE.md        - Core testing reference
  5. docs/testing/RUNTIME_DEBUGGING.md    - Runtime validation system

Priority 3 - SDK Integration (3 min):
  6. docs/current/SDK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md  - How we use Project-X SDK
  7. docs/current/MULTI_SYMBOL_SUPPORT.md   - Account-wide risk

Priority 4 - API Reference (For Coding/Testing):

```

**Key Innovation - Layered Responsibility:**
```
Your Rule Specs           SDK Provides              We Build
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE-001: Max Contracts   ✅ Position events        🔧 Net calculation logic
                          ✅ close_position()       🔧 Breach detection
                                                    🔧 Logging

RULE-003: Daily Loss      ✅ Trade events (P&L)     🔧 Daily P&L tracking (SQLite)
                          ✅ close_position()       🔧 Lockout manager
                          ✅ cancel_orders()        🔧 Reset scheduler (5 PM)
                                                    🔧 Breach detection
```

### 3.2 API Reference (SDK_API_REFERENCE.md)

**Critical for preventing test/code mismatches**

**CLAUDE.md warning:**
```markdown
### ⚠️ BEFORE Writing Code or Tests - Read API Contracts!

**CRITICAL**: Always check actual API signatures to prevent test/code mismatches!

# 1. Check our API contracts
Read SDK_API_REFERENCE.md

# 2. Check actual implementation
from risk_manager.core.events import RiskEvent
import inspect
print(inspect.signature(RiskEvent.__init__))

# 3. Verify enum values exist
from risk_manager.core.events import EventType
print([e.name for e in EventType])

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Using `RiskEvent(type=...)` → ✅ Use `RiskEvent(event_type=...)`
- ❌ Using `EventType.TRADE_EXECUTED` → ✅ Check if it exists first!
- ❌ Using `PnLTracker(account_id=...)` → ✅ Use `PnLTracker(db=...)`
```

### 3.3 Quick Reference Card (CLAUDE.md)

**5 most important files:**
```
1. `CLAUDE.md` ← You are here
2. `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` ← Current progress
3. `test_reports/latest.txt` ← Latest test results
4. `docs/testing/TESTING_GUIDE.md` ← How to test
5. `docs/testing/RUNTIME_DEBUGGING.md` ← How to debug runtime
```

**5 most important commands:**
```
1. `python run_tests.py` ← Run tests with menu
2. `cat test_reports/latest.txt` ← Check latest results
3. `cat docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` ← Check progress
4. `pytest --collect-only` ← See available tests
5. `python run_tests.py → [s]` ← Runtime smoke test
```

**Exit codes to know:**
```
- `0` = Success
- `1` = Exception (check logs)
- `2` = Boot stalled (check event subscriptions)
```

**8 checkpoints to look for:**
```
🚀 Service Start
✅ Config Loaded
✅ SDK Connected
✅ Rules Initialized
✅ Event Loop Running
📨 Event Received
🔍 Rule Evaluated
⚠️ Enforcement Triggered
```

## 4. Developer Workflows

### 4.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow

**Core philosophy:** "Tests written first, then implementation"

**TDD Workflow (CLAUDE.md):**
```
1. Write test first (it fails - RED)
2. Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor (REFACTOR)
4. Run `[s]` smoke test (validate runtime works)
5. Repeat
```

**Test Structure Guidance:**
```
- Use `pytest --collect-only` to see all available tests
- Use `ls -R tests/` to see current test structure
- Check `test_reports/latest.txt` for most recent results
```

**Complete guides:**
```
- `docs/testing/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Core TDD guide
- `docs/testing/RUNTIME_DEBUGGING.md` - Runtime validation
- `docs/testing/WORKING_WITH_AI.md` - AI workflow
```

### 4.2 Interactive Test Runner Workflow

**Command:** `python run_tests.py`

**11 Workflow Patterns in WORKING_WITH_AI.md:**

**Workflow 1: Starting Fresh - Run Unit Tests**
```
Step 1: Run unit tests
Step 2: Check results
  - GREEN: Move to Integration Tests
  - RED: Go to Workflow 2
```

**Workflow 2: Unit Test Failed - Fix Process**
```
Step 1: Identify failure (cat test_reports/latest.txt)
Step 2: Copy error to AI
Step 3: AI analyzes and suggests fix
Step 4: Apply fix
Step 5: Rerun failed tests ([9] Rerun last failed)
Step 6: Repeat until GREEN
```

**Workflow 3-10:** Integration, E2E, TDD, Coverage, HTML Reports, Debugging, Pattern-Based, Continuous Testing

**Workflow 11: Runtime Debugging with AI (⭐ NEW)**
```
Step 1: Run system health check ([S])
Step 2: Check exit code (0/1/2+)
Step 3: Configuration debugging with AI (if exit 1)
Step 4: Runtime error debugging with AI (if exit 2+)
Step 5: Run specific checkpoint
Step 6: Generate debug report ([G])
Step 7: AI-guided E2E validation
```

```
1. python run_tests.py → [S] Runtime Health Check ⭐ NEW
2. python run_tests.py → [2] Unit tests
3. Fix any failures with AI
4. Get all tests GREEN
```

**During development:**
```
1. Write test first (TDD)
2. Implement feature
3. Run [9] Last failed until GREEN
4. Check coverage periodically
5. Run [R] Runtime Diagnostics after core changes ⭐ NEW
```

**Before commit/push:**
```
1. python run_tests.py → [S] System Health Check ⭐ NEW
2. python run_tests.py → [1] All tests
3. python run_tests.py → [5] Coverage report
4. Ensure >90% coverage
5. All tests GREEN
6. All runtime checkpoints PASS ⭐ NEW
```

**Before deployment:**
```
1. python run_tests.py → [E] End-to-End Flow ⭐ NEW
2. python run_tests.py → [G] Generate Debug Report ⭐ NEW
3. Share report with AI for final validation

4. Update test documentation
5. Run full runtime validation suite ⭐ NEW
```

### 4.4 Common Tasks with AI (WORKING_WITH_AI.md)

**Best Practices:**

**1. Always provide full context:**
```
BAD:  "Test failed"
GOOD: "test_daily_realized_loss.py::test_limit_exceeded failed
       Expected: DENY
       Got: ALLOW
       Here's the test code: [paste]"
```

**2. Share test reports:**
```bash
cat test_reports/latest.txt | pbcopy  # Mac
cat test_reports/latest.txt | xclip   # Linux
```

**3. Use specific commands:**
```
BAD:  "Run tests"
GOOD: "Run: pytest tests/unit/rules/test_daily_loss.py -v"
```

**4. Reference file paths:**
```
"Edit: /home/jakers/projects/simple-risk-manager/simple risk manager/src/rules/daily_loss.py
Line 45: Change threshold from 100 to 200"
```

**5. Verify fixes:**
```
"Applied your fix.
Rerunning: pytest tests/unit/rules/test_daily_loss.py
Result: [paste]"
```

**Common AI Prompts:**

**For new features:**
```
"Need to add feature X that does Y.
Please:
1. Write failing test first
2. Show me the test code
3. I'll confirm it fails
4. Then implement feature"
```

**For bug fixes:**
```
"Bug: [describe behavior]
Expected: [what should happen]
Actual: [what happens]
Test that fails: [paste test output]
Please suggest fix"
```

**For refactoring:**
```
"This code works but is messy:
[paste code]

Refactor while keeping tests green:
[paste test file that covers it]"
```

**For coverage:**
```
"Coverage is 75% on this module:
[paste coverage output]

Missing lines: 45-52, 67-71
Generate tests for uncovered code"
```

## 7. Key Innovations

### 7.1 Adaptable Documentation Philosophy

**Problem:** Hard-coded structures go stale immediately

**Solution:** Reference-based documentation

**Implementation:**
```markdown
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Adaptable Documentation

**This file uses REFERENCES, not hard-coded structures.**

- ❌ **DON'T** rely on cached file trees or progress percentages
- ✅ **DO** use paths and check actual files for current state
- ✅ **DO** use `ls`, `find`, `pytest --collect-only` to see structure
- ✅ **DO** read `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for latest progress
- ✅ **DO** check `test_reports/latest.txt` for most recent test results
```

**Benefits:**
- Documentation never goes stale
- AI agents always get current state
- No manual progress tracking
- Self-updating through file checks

### 7.2 Test Reports Auto-Save System

**Innovation:** Every test run auto-saves to timestamped files

**Files:**
```
test_reports/
├── latest.txt (always most recent, overwritten)
├── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_passed.txt (timestamped successes)
└── YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_failed.txt (timestamped failures)
```

**AI Workflow Integration:**
```
1. User runs tests via menu → Auto-saves to test_reports/latest.txt
2. User says "fix test errors"
3. AI reads test_reports/latest.txt
4. AI identifies failures and fixes them
5. Repeat until all tests pass
```

**No manual copy-paste needed!**

### 7.3 8-Checkpoint Logging System

**Purpose:** Find exactly where runtime fails

**Checkpoints:**
```
Checkpoint 1: 🚀 Service Start
Checkpoint 2: ✅ Config Loaded
Checkpoint 3: ✅ SDK Connected
Checkpoint 4: ✅ Rules Initialized
Checkpoint 5: ✅ Event Loop Running
Checkpoint 6: 📨 Event Received
Checkpoint 7: 🔍 Rule Evaluated
Checkpoint 8: ⚠️ Enforcement Triggered
```

**Visual debugging:**
```bash
# Find where it stopped
cat data/logs/risk_manager.log | tail -20

# Look for last emoji checkpoint:
# 🚀 ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ 📨 🔍 ⚠️
#         ^^^ Stopped at checkpoint 3 (SDK connected)
```

### 7.4 Runtime Reliability Pack

**Problem:** Tests green but runtime broken

**Solution:** 5 runtime validation capabilities

**Capabilities:**
```
1. Smoke Test ([s]) - 8s boot validation
   Exit 0 = Success
   Exit 1 = Exception
   Exit 2 = Boot stalled

2. Soak Test ([r]) - 30-60s stability check

3. Trace Mode ([t]) - Deep async debugging

4. Log Viewer ([l]) - Real-time log streaming

5. Env Snapshot ([e]) - Configuration dump
```

**Workflow:**
```
Step 1: pytest (automated)
  └─ All pass ✅

Step 2: Runtime validation (enforced liveness)
  └─ [s] Smoke Test ← Proves first event fires within 8s
  └─ Exit code 0 = Actually works!

Step 3: Deploy with confidence!
```

### 7.5 AI-First Design

**Every aspect designed for AI consumption:**

**1. Structured Entry Point (CLAUDE.md)**
- Clear priority reading order
- Time estimates for each section
- Learning outcomes stated upfront

**2. Machine-Readable Formats**
- Test reports in plain text
- Log files with emoji markers
- Exit codes with defined meanings

**3. Prompt Templates**
- "Where Did We Leave Off?" template
- Error reporting templates
- Fix verification templates

**4. Context Management**
- "Read this file first" instructions
- Cross-references with exact paths
- Quick access commands provided

**5. Troubleshooting Flowcharts**
- If X then Y decision trees
- Checkpoint-to-root-cause mappings
- Step-by-step repair procedures

### 7.6 Dual Entry Points (Human vs AI)

**Human Entry Point (README.md):**
- Marketing pitch
- Feature highlights
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Visual architecture diagrams

**AI Entry Point (CLAUDE.md):**
- Direct instructions
- File reading order
- Current state checks
- Testing protocols
- Technical constraints

**No confusion about which to use!**

### 7.7 Session Continuity System

**"Where Did We Leave Off?" workflow:**

**Template Response:**
```
**Last Session**: 2025-10-23

**Reading Status**:
1. ✅ Read `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` to see current progress
2. ✅ Read `test_reports/latest.txt` to see latest test results

**Status**: [Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for completion percentage]
**Latest Test Results**: [Check test_reports/latest.txt]
**What's Working**: [List from PROJECT_STATUS.md]
**What's Next**: [Next priorities from PROJECT_STATUS.md]
```

**AI can resume exactly where left off with 2 file reads!**

### 7.8 Update Maintenance System

**When to update CLAUDE.md:**
```
- [ ] Major architecture changes
- [ ] Documentation reorganization
- [ ] New critical features added (like Runtime Reliability Pack)
- [ ] Testing system changes
- [ ] Progress milestones (25% → 50% → etc.)
- [ ] Next priority changes
```

**Version tracking:**
```
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Next Update**: When testing system or documentation changes significantly
**Maintainer**: Update this when project structure or testing system changes
```

**Self-maintaining documentation!**
