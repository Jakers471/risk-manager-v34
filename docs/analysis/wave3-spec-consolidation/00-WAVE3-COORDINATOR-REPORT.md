# Wave 3: Specification Consolidation & Unification - Coordinator Report

**Document ID:** 00-WAVE3-COORDINATOR-REPORT
**Created:** 2025-10-25
**Coordinator:** Wave 3 Coordinator - Spec Unification Specialist
**Mission:** Create unified, conflict-free specifications for all 88 features
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Delegation

---

## Executive Summary

### Mission Status
‚úÖ **Phase 1-2 Complete:** Discovery, Conflict Analysis, and Resolution Strategy defined
üîÑ **Phase 3 Ready:** Delegation plan created for 6 specialized researchers
‚è≥ **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for complete spec unification

### Critical Findings

1. **5 Major Conflicts Identified** requiring resolution
2. **88 Total Features** across 8 domains need unified specs
3. **User Architectural Guidance** provided as authoritative override
4. **Clear Resolution Rules** established (6-tier priority system)
5. **No Architectural Blockers** - conflicts are resolvable

### Key Conflicts Summary

| Conflict | Domain | Severity | Resolution Approach |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| RULE-004/005 Enforcement Type | Risk Rules | High | **Use Categories Doc** (more recent, explicit correction) |
| RULE-013 Missing Spec | Risk Rules | High | **Create using RULE-003 template** |
| Admin Unlock Mentions | Risk Rules | Critical | **Apply User Guidance** (use reset schedules, NOT manual unlock) |
| Architecture v1 vs v2 | Architecture | Medium | **Use v2** (evolved, production-ready) |
| API vs SDK Approach | SDK Integration | Low | **Use SDK-first** (93% code reduction proven) |

### User Architectural Guidance (AUTHORITATIVE)

**Admin Role:**
- ‚úÖ Admin configures risk settings
- ‚úÖ Admin locks configurations (trader cannot modify)
- ‚ùå Admin does NOT manually unlock accounts for trading

**Enforcement Model:**
- ‚úÖ Every rule auto-enforces via: reset schedules, trade-by-trade, time-based
- ‚úÖ System is autonomous once configured
- ‚úÖ Rules use: daily reset (midnight ET), session-based, trade-by-trade logic
- ‚ùå NO manual admin intervention for trading lockouts

**This means:**
- RULE-004, RULE-005 conflicts: **Use reset schedules**, NOT admin unlock
- Any spec mentioning "admin unlock for trading" is **WRONG**
- **Use this as resolution authority**

---

## Phase 1-2: Discovery & Analysis (COMPLETE)

### Conflicts Inventory

#### Conflict 1: RULE-004 Enforcement Type

**Source A - Primary Spec** (`04_daily_unrealized_loss.md`, 2025-01-17):
- Enforcement Type: Hard Lockout (Category 3)
- Action: Close ALL positions
- Lockout: Yes, until reset time
- Trader Can Trade Again: At reset time (5 PM)

**Source B - Categories Doc** (`RULE_CATEGORIES.md`, 2025-10-23):
- Enforcement Type: Trade-by-Trade (Category 1)
- Action: Close ONLY that losing position
- Lockout: NO lockout
- Trader Can Trade Again: Immediately

**Conflict Note in Categories Doc:**
```
**Critical Changes**:
- RULE-004, 005, 008 are trade-by-trade (NOT close all)
- Corrected enforcement categories
```

**Resolution:** **Use Categories Doc (Source B)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Resolution Rule #3:** Newest Specification (Categories Doc is 2025-10-23, Primary is 2025-01-17)
2. **Explicit Correction:** Categories doc states "corrected enforcement categories"
3. **Better Design:** Trade-by-Trade makes more sense (close losing position only, keep winners open)
4. **Aligns with Position-Level Risk Management:** More granular control
5. **User Guidance:** Auto-enforcement via trade-by-trade logic (no admin unlock)

**Action Required:**
- Update `04_daily_unrealized_loss.md` to reflect Trade-by-Trade enforcement
- Create unified spec in Wave 3 output

---

#### Conflict 2: RULE-005 Enforcement Type

**Source A - Primary Spec** (`05_max_unrealized_profit.md`, 2025-01-17):
- Enforcement Type: Hard Lockout
- Action: Close ALL positions (lock in profit)
- Lockout: Yes, until reset time
- Use Case: "Hit daily target, stop trading completely"

**Source B - Categories Doc** (`RULE_CATEGORIES.md`, 2025-10-23):
- Enforcement Type: Trade-by-Trade (Category 1)
- Action: Close ONLY that winning position (take profit)
- Lockout: NO lockout
- Use Case: "Take profit on winner, keep trading"

**Resolution:** **Make Configurable (Both Valid)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Both Approaches Valid:**
   - Trade-by-Trade: More flexible, take profit and continue
   - Hard Lockout: More conservative, "take the win and walk away"
2. **User Preference:** Different traders have different strategies
3. **Resolution Rule #4:** Most Detailed Specification (include both modes)
4. **User Guidance:** Support both autonomous modes (reset schedule OR trade-by-trade)

**Action Required:**
- Create unified spec with configurable `enforcement_mode` parameter
- Default: Trade-by-Trade (more flexible)
- Option: Hard Lockout (more conservative)

**Example Unified Config:**
```yaml
max_unrealized_profit:
  enabled: true
  target: 1000.0
  enforcement_mode: "trade_by_trade"  # or "hard_lockout"
  lockout_until_reset: false  # true if hard_lockout mode
  reset_time: "17:00"  # Only if lockout_until_reset=true
```

---

#### Conflict 3: RULE-013 Missing Dedicated Spec

**Found In:**
- `RULE_CATEGORIES.md` (lines 239-271) - Good summary
- Enforcement Matrix (lines 219-236) - Configuration details

**Missing:**
- No `13_daily_realized_profit.md` file in `/docs/PROJECT_DOCS/rules/`
- No detailed implementation guide
- No test scenarios
- No API requirements
- No edge cases documented

**Resolution:** **Create Full Specification**

**Rationale:**
1. **Consistency:** All 12 other rules have dedicated spec files
2. **Implementation Readiness:** Teams need detailed specs to implement
3. **Template Available:** RULE-003 (DailyRealizedLoss) is nearly identical (opposite direction)
4. **User Guidance:** Needs autonomous reset schedule enforcement

**Action Required:**
- Create `13_daily_realized_profit.md` matching RULE-003 detail level
- Include: trigger logic, enforcement actions, SQLite schema, test scenarios, API requirements
- Use RULE-003 as template (similar logic, positive threshold instead of negative)

---

#### Conflict 4: Admin Unlock Mentions in Specs

**Problem:** Several specs mention "admin manually unlocks account"

**Found In:**
- RULE-003: "Lockout until reset or **admin override**"
- RULE-009: "Lockout until session start or **admin override**"
- RULE-010: "Lockout until API clears or **admin override**"
- RULE-013: "Lockout until reset or **admin override**"

**User Guidance Override:**
> **Admin does NOT manually unlock accounts for trading**
> **Every rule auto-enforces via: reset schedules, trade-by-trade, time-based**
> **NO manual admin intervention for trading lockouts**

**Resolution:** **Apply User Guidance (Highest Priority)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Resolution Rule #1:** User Guidance is AUTHORITATIVE (overrides all specs)
2. **Architectural Decision:** System is autonomous once configured
3. **Correct Enforcement:** Use reset schedules, session-based, or trade-by-trade logic
4. **No Manual Intervention:** Admin configures, system auto-enforces

**Corrected Enforcement:**
- ‚úÖ RULE-003: Lockout until **daily reset at 5 PM** (automatic)
- ‚úÖ RULE-009: Lockout until **session start** (automatic via scheduler)
- ‚úÖ RULE-010: Lockout until **API sends `canTrade: true`** (automatic)
- ‚úÖ RULE-013: Lockout until **daily reset at 5 PM** (automatic)
- ‚ùå ~~Admin manually unlocks~~ (remove from all specs)

**Action Required:**
- Update all 4 rule specs to remove "admin override" mentions
- Document autonomous unlock mechanisms only
- Clarify that admin can configure rules, but NOT override runtime enforcement

---

#### Conflict 5: Architecture v1 vs v2

**v1 (Initial Planning, 2025-01-17):**
- Basic architecture outline
- No MOD-001 to MOD-004 modules
- Manual API integration assumptions
- Simpler structure

**v2 (Refined Architecture, 2025-01-17 - later same day):**
- Production-ready modular design
- Four core modules (MOD-001 to MOD-004)
- Enhanced state management
- Clear separation of concerns
- SDK-first approach (note: SDK didn't exist when v1 written)

**Resolution:** **Use v2 (Evolved Design)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Resolution Rule #2:** Actual Implementation (v2 is what's being built)
2. **Resolution Rule #4:** Most Detailed Specification (v2 is more comprehensive)
3. **Better Design:** v2 is production-ready with proven modularity
4. **No Contradiction:** v2 is refinement of v1, not replacement

**Action Required:**
- Use v2 architecture in all unified specs
- Document v1 as historical context
- Note: Both specs written before SDK existed (context matters)

---

### Additional Observations

#### Non-Conflicts (Clarifications Needed)

**1. SDK vs Manual API Integration:**
- Original specs written BEFORE Project-X-Py SDK existed
- Specs describe manual WebSocket handling (outdated)
- Current implementation is SDK-first (93% code reduction)
- **Not a conflict**, just outdated context
- **Action:** Update integration specs to reflect SDK-first approach

**2. Missing Implementation vs Spec:**
- 10 of 13 rules have no implementation (77% gap)
- 3 state managers missing (MOD-002, MOD-003, MOD-004)
- **Not a conflict**, just work to be done
- **Action:** No spec changes needed, just implementation

**3. Brief Specs (RULE-004, 005, 010, 011):**
- Some specs are only 40-50 lines
- Others are 200-300 lines
- **Not a conflict**, just varying detail levels
- **Action:** Expand brief specs in unified version

---

## Resolution Strategy

### Resolution Rules (Priority Order)

**Priority 1: User Guidance** ‚≠ê HIGHEST AUTHORITY
- User's architectural decisions override all specs
- Example: "No admin unlock for trading" = remove all mentions
- When to use: User explicitly provides design decision

**Priority 2: Actual Implementation**
- Code in `src/` is ground truth
- If spec conflicts with working code, code wins
- When to use: Spec describes one thing, implementation does another (and works)

**Priority 3: Newest Specification**
- More recent specs are more refined
- Later dates indicate updated thinking
- When to use: Two specs contradict, check timestamps

**Priority 4: Most Detailed Specification**
- Comprehensive specs over brief summaries
- 200-line spec > 40-line spec
- When to use: One source has way more detail

**Priority 5: Security Model**
- For enforcement decisions, security wins
- Prevent account violations > user convenience
- When to use: Conflict about enforcement strictness

**Priority 6: SDK Integration**
- SDK-first approach over manual API
- Proven 93% code reduction
- When to use: Conflict about how to integrate with TopstepX

### Application Examples

**Example 1: RULE-004 Enforcement Type**
- Conflict: Primary spec says "Hard Lockout", Categories doc says "Trade-by-Trade"
- **Apply Rule #3:** Newest Specification (Categories doc is 2025-10-23, Primary is 2025-01-17)
- **Result:** Use Trade-by-Trade from Categories doc
- **Bonus:** Categories doc explicitly says "corrected enforcement categories"

**Example 2: Admin Unlock Mentions**
- Conflict: Specs say "admin override", User says "no admin unlock"
- **Apply Rule #1:** User Guidance (HIGHEST priority)
- **Result:** Remove all "admin override" mentions, use reset schedules only

**Example 3: Architecture v1 vs v2**
- Conflict: Two architecture versions exist
- **Apply Rule #2:** Actual Implementation (v2 is what's being built)
- **Apply Rule #4:** Most Detailed Specification (v2 is more comprehensive)
- **Result:** Use v2 architecture

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Coordinator)
1. ‚úÖ Create delegation plan (this report)
2. ‚è≥ Spawn 6 researcher agents with specific instructions
3. ‚è≥ Monitor progress (daily check-ins)
4. ‚è≥ Review outputs as researchers complete work

### Researcher Instructions (To be delegated)
Each researcher will receive:
- This coordination report (context)
- Specific input document list
- Conflicts to resolve
- Unified spec template
- Output file locations
- Success criteria

### Success Criteria
Each researcher must:
- ‚úÖ Create unified specs for all features in their domain
- ‚úÖ Resolve all identified conflicts
- ‚úÖ Document resolution rationale
- ‚úÖ Follow unified spec template exactly
- ‚úÖ Include version history
- ‚úÖ Reference all original sources
- ‚úÖ Document implementation status from Wave 2
- ‚úÖ Provide code examples where available

### Final Deliverable
- `/docs/specifications/unified/` directory with:
  - `rules/` (13 files) - Unified rule specs
  - `architecture/` (6 files) - Unified architecture docs
  - `sdk-integration.md` - Unified SDK approach
  - `testing-strategy.md` - Unified testing approach
  - `configuration/` (3 files) - Unified config docs
  - `cli-reference.md` - Unified CLI docs

**Total:** ~31 unified specification files covering all 88 features

---

## Key Principles for Researchers

### 1. User Guidance is LAW
When user provides architectural decisions, they **override all specs**. No exceptions.

### 2. No Information Loss
Every source document must be referenced. Nothing is thrown away. Even outdated specs are preserved in "Version History" for context.

### 3. Clear Rationale
Every conflict resolution must explain **WHY** that choice was made. Reference resolution rules explicitly.

### 4. Implementation-Ready
Unified specs should be clear enough to code from. Include SQLite schemas, API endpoints, configuration examples, test scenarios.

### 5. Version History Matters
Track the evolution of specs over time. v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0 ‚Üí v3.0 (unified). Context matters.

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Researcher Consistency:** 6 different researchers might interpret template differently
   - **Mitigation:** Provide detailed template, examples, and clear success criteria

2. **Missed Conflicts:** Researchers might not spot all conflicts
   - **Mitigation:** Coordinator review phase (Phase 4) catches missed conflicts

### Medium Risk
1. **Spec Interpretation:** Different researchers might resolve conflicts differently
   - **Mitigation:** Clear resolution rules (6-tier priority system)

2. **Timeline Slippage:** Some researchers might take longer
   - **Mitigation:** Daily check-ins, offer support if needed

### Low Risk
1. **Template Compliance:** Researchers might deviate from template
   - **Mitigation:** Clear template with examples, easy to follow

---

## Conclusion

**Wave 3 is ready to execute.**

### Summary
- ‚úÖ 5 major conflicts identified and resolution approach defined
- ‚úÖ 6 specialized researchers ready to work in parallel
- ‚úÖ Clear resolution rules (6-tier priority system)
- ‚úÖ User architectural guidance provides authoritative override
- ‚úÖ Unified spec template ready
- ‚úÖ Timeline: 2-3 weeks to completion

### Critical Success Factors
1. **User Guidance Applied:** All "admin unlock" mentions removed, reset schedules used
2. **RULE-004/005 Conflicts Resolved:** Use newer categories doc approach
3. **RULE-013 Created:** Using RULE-003 as template
4. **Architecture v2 Used:** Production-ready modular design
5. **SDK-First Documented:** Proven 93% code reduction approach

### Next Action
**DO NOT spawn researchers yet** - Coordinator to review this plan first, then delegate to 6 researchers in parallel.

---

**Report Complete - Ready for Delegation**

**Coordinator:** Wave 3 Coordinator - Spec Unification Specialist
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Planning Complete, Awaiting Approval to Proceed
**Next Phase:** Delegate to 6 Researchers (Phase 3)
