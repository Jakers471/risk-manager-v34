## Key Findings Summary

### Conflicts Identified
- **Total:** 5 major conflicts
- **Critical:** 1 (Admin unlock model - user guidance override)
- **High:** 2 (RULE-004/005 enforcement type, RULE-013 missing spec)
- **Medium:** 1 (Architecture v1 vs v2)
- **Low:** 1 (API vs SDK - contextual, not real conflict)

### Resolution Confidence
- **All conflicts resolvable:** 100%
- **Resolution framework:** 6-tier priority system
- **User guidance provided:** Authoritative override for critical conflict
- **No architectural blockers:** Clear path forward

### Impact Assessment
- **Features affected:** 7 of 88 (8%)
- **Rules affected:** 5 of 13 risk rules (38%)
- **Implementation impact:** Minimal (spec updates only, no code changes)
- **Timeline impact:** None (resolutions don't delay implementation)

## User Architectural Guidance (AUTHORITATIVE)

**From Coordinator Report - This is LAW:**

### Admin Role
- ✅ Admin configures risk settings
- ✅ Admin locks configurations (trader cannot modify)
- ❌ Admin does NOT manually unlock accounts for trading

### Enforcement Model
- ✅ Every rule auto-enforces via: reset schedules, trade-by-trade, time-based
- ✅ System is autonomous once configured
- ✅ Rules use: daily reset (midnight ET), session-based, trade-by-trade logic
- ❌ NO manual admin intervention for trading lockouts

**This overrides all conflicting specifications.**

## Resolution Rule Priority (Quick Reference)

```
1. User Guidance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGHEST (overrides everything)
2. Actual Implementation ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (code is truth)
3. Newest Specification ⭐⭐⭐ (evolution matters)
4. Most Detailed Specification ⭐⭐ (completeness wins)
5. Security Model ⭐ (prevent violations)
6. SDK Integration (proven approach)
```

**Apply in order. First rule that applies wins.**

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Researcher Delegation (IN PROGRESS)
6 specialized researchers create unified specs:

| Researcher | Domain | Files | Effort | Status |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Risk Rules | 13 | 3-4 days | ⏳ Ready to start |
| 2 | Architecture | 6 | 2-3 days | ⏳ Ready to start |
| 3 | SDK Integration | 3 | 2 days | ⏳ Ready to start |
| 4 | Testing Strategy | 3 | 2 days | ⏳ Ready to start |
| 5 | Configuration | 3 | 2 days | ⏳ Ready to start |
| 6 | CLI | 3 | 2 days | ⏳ Ready to start |

**All can work in parallel** - no dependencies between researchers

### Phase 4: Review & Validation (NOT STARTED)
- Coordinator reviews all unified specs
- Validates conflict resolutions
- Checks completeness
- Final approval

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks total

## Success Criteria

### For Each Unified Spec
- ✅ Single canonical specification (one source of truth)
- ✅ Conflict resolutions documented (what conflicted, why we chose X)
- ✅ Version history (v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0 unified)
- ✅ Original sources referenced (file paths, line numbers)
- ✅ Implementation status (from Wave 2 gap analysis)
- ✅ Examples (code, config, usage)
- ✅ Tests (coverage status)

### For Wave 3 Complete
- ✅ All 5 conflicts resolved
- ✅ All 88 features have unified specs
- ✅ All resolution rationales clear
- ✅ All sources referenced
- ✅ Implementation-ready specifications
