## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Created RULE-013 from Scratch ✅

**Issue**: RULE-013 (DailyRealizedProfit) was mentioned in categories doc but had no dedicated specification file.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive unified spec (12.2 KB) using RULE-003 as template.

**Contents**:
- Full trigger condition logic
- Hard lockout enforcement (per user guidance)
- Timer-based auto-unlock (configurable)
- Configuration examples
- Database schema (shared with RULE-003)
- Examples and test scenarios
- Conflict resolutions
- Implementation notes

### 2. Resolved RULE-004 Enforcement Conflict ✅

**Conflict**: Original spec said "Hard Lockout", updated categories doc said "Trade-by-Trade"

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ **User Guidance (Resolution Rule #1)**: "UNREALIZED PnL Rules: Trade-by-trade enforcement"
- ✅ Changed from Hard Lockout → Trade-by-Trade
- ✅ Close ONLY the specific position that breached
- ✅ NO lockout, NO timer
- ✅ Trader can continue trading immediately

**Documentation**:
- Conflict documented in unified spec
- Resolution rationale explained
- User guidance cited as highest authority
- Version history notes major change

### 3. Resolved RULE-005 Enforcement Conflict ✅

**Conflict**: Original spec said "Hard Lockout" (take profit and stop for day), updated categories doc said "Trade-by-Trade"

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ **User Guidance (Resolution Rule #1)**: "UNREALIZED PnL Rules: Trade-by-trade enforcement"
- ✅ Changed from Hard Lockout → Trade-by-Trade
- ✅ Close ONLY that winning position (take profit)
- ✅ Keep other positions open
- ✅ NO lockout, NO timer
- ✅ Trader can continue trading

**Philosophy Documented**:
- **Trade-by-Trade**: "Take profit on winner, keep trading" (flexible)
- **Hard Lockout**: "Hit daily target, stop completely" (use RULE-013 for this)

### 4. Applied Timer-Based Unlocks to All Hard Lockout Rules ✅

**User Guidance**: "NO admin manual unlock - timer only. Timer is CONFIGURABLE (not hardcoded)."

**Rules Updated**:
- ✅ **RULE-003** (DailyRealizedLoss): Timer-based unlock at configurable reset_time
- ✅ **RULE-013** (DailyRealizedProfit): Timer-based unlock at configurable reset_time
- ✅ **RULE-009** (SessionBlockOutside): Timer-based unlock at session start time
- ✅ **RULE-010** (AuthLossGuard): API-driven unlock (when `canTrade: true`)

**All specs now include**:
- ❌ NO mentions of "admin manual unlock"
- ✅ Configurable reset times (not hardcoded)
- ✅ Timer-based auto-unlock clearly documented
- ✅ Examples of timer expiration behavior

### 5. Documented All Conflict Resolutions ✅

**Every unified spec includes**:
- "Conflict Resolutions" section
- Source A vs Source B comparisons (with file paths and line numbers)
- Resolution decision with rationale
- User Guidance cited when applicable
- Version history noting changes

**Total Conflicts Resolved**: 8 major conflicts across 5 rules

## User Guidance Application Summary

### Resolution Rule #1 (HIGHEST AUTHORITY) - Applied Everywhere

**UNREALIZED PnL Rules** (RULE-004, RULE-005):
- ✅ Trade-by-trade enforcement
- ✅ Close ONLY the specific position that breached
- ✅ NO lockout, NO timer
- ✅ Trader continues trading immediately
- ✅ Documented unrealized → realized P&L interaction

**REALIZED PnL Rules** (RULE-003, RULE-013):
- ✅ Hard lockout enforcement
- ✅ Close ALL positions account-wide
- ✅ Timer-based unlock (configurable reset_time)
- ✅ NO admin manual unlock
- ✅ If trader attempts trade while locked → close immediately

**Admin Role**:
- ✅ Admin configures rules, timers, schedules
- ✅ Admin does NOT manually unlock trading lockouts
- ✅ All lockouts are timer/schedule-based (automatic)

**Reset Schedule**:
- ✅ MUST be configurable (not hardcoded)
- ✅ Example configurations provided
- ✅ Timezone support documented

## Specification Quality Assessment

### Template Adherence

**All 13 specs follow mandatory template**:
- ✅ Category, Priority, Status header
- ✅ Purpose section
- ✅ Trigger Condition with logic
- ✅ Enforcement Action (with user guidance applied)
- ✅ Configuration Parameters (YAML examples)
- ✅ State Requirements checklist
- ✅ SDK Integration requirements
- ✅ Database Schema (if needed)
- ✅ Examples (realistic scenarios)
- ✅ Conflict Resolutions section
- ✅ Version History
- ✅ Original Sources (with file paths)
- ✅ Implementation Status (from Wave 2)
- ✅ Test Coverage requirements
- ✅ Related Rules

### Detail Levels

**Comprehensive** (9+ KB):
- RULE-003 (9.4 KB)
- RULE-004 (10.4 KB)
- RULE-005 (11.0 KB)
- RULE-013 (12.2 KB)

**Standard** (2-3 KB):
- RULE-001 (2.6 KB)
- RULE-002 (2.9 KB)
- RULE-006 (3.0 KB)

**Concise** (1-2 KB):
- RULE-007 through RULE-012 (1.0-1.7 KB each)

**Rationale**:
- Critical rules (account violation, conflicts) got comprehensive treatment
- Implemented rules (RULE-001, RULE-002) got standard treatment
- Straightforward rules got concise treatment
- All include necessary information for implementation

- Only differ in direction (loss vs profit)

### 2. Cascading Enforcement

- RULE-004, RULE-005, RULE-012

**State Managers** block 8 rules:
- MOD-002 blocks 5 rules
- MOD-003 blocks 3 rules
- MOD-004 blocks 3 rules

## Recommendations

### For Implementation Team
1. **Use unified specs as single source of truth** (not original specs)
2. **Follow enforcement patterns** documented in README
3. **Validate user guidance** application in code reviews
4. **Test conflict resolutions** (especially RULE-004, RULE-005)
5. **Implement state managers first** (unblocks 8 rules)

### For Documentation
1. **Archive original specs** (keep for reference, mark as superseded)
2. **Update all links** to point to unified specs
3. **Create migration guide** (original spec → unified spec changes)
4. **Document design decisions** from user guidance

### For Testing
1. **Test timer-based unlocks** (critical for RULE-003, 013, 009)
2. **Test trade-by-trade enforcement** (RULE-004, 005)
3. **Test cascading enforcement** (unrealized → realized interactions)
4. **Test configurable reset times** (different timezones)

## Conclusion

**Wave 3 Risk Rules Specification Unification: COMPLETE**

All 13 risk rules now have unified, conflict-free specifications with user's authoritative architectural guidance applied. The project is ready to proceed with implementation using these specs as the single source of truth.

**Key Achievement**: Resolved all major conflicts, created missing RULE-013, and applied user guidance to ensure timer-based unlocks and trade-by-trade enforcement for unrealized P&L rules.
