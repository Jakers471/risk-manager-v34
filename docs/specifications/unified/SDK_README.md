# Unified Specifications - SDK Integration

**Created:** 2025-10-25 (Wave 3: Specification Unification)
**Status:** Complete
**Research Team:** Wave 3 Researcher 3 - SDK Integration Specification Unification

---

## Overview

This directory contains **unified, authoritative specifications** for SDK integration in Risk Manager V34. These specifications resolve conflicts between original specs (pre-SDK) and current implementation (SDK-first).

### Key Decision: SDK-First Architecture

**Historical Context:**
- Original specifications (`docs/archive/.../01-specifications/projectx_gateway_api/`) were written **before Project-X-Py SDK existed**
- At that time, manual API integration was required (REST + SignalR WebSocket)
- ~1200 lines of custom API client code would have been needed

**Current Approach (V34):**
- ✅ Use **Project-X-Py SDK v3.5.9+** as foundation
- ✅ SDK handles authentication, WebSocket, reconnection, error handling
- ✅ ~93% reduction in API integration code
- ✅ More reliable, battle-tested SDK implementation

**Resolution:** SDK-first architecture is the official approach. Original manual API specs are **archived for historical reference only**.

## Specifications in This Directory

### 1. sdk-integration.md
**Document ID:** UNIFIED-SDK-001
**Status:** Complete

**Purpose:** Comprehensive SDK integration specification

**Contents:**
- SDK components (TradingSuite, PositionManager, OrderManager, QuoteManager)
- Integration patterns (SuiteManager, EventBridge, TradingIntegration)
- Quote data integration for unrealized P&L ⭐ NEW
- Configuration
- Error handling
- Testing strategy
- SDK vs Manual API comparison (93% code reduction)

**Who Should Read This:**
- Developers implementing SDK integration
- Developers working on enforcement actions
- Anyone needing to understand how SDK wraps TopstepX API

### 2. event-handling.md
**Document ID:** UNIFIED-SDK-002
**Status:** Complete

**Purpose:** Event-driven architecture specification

**Contents:**
- Event types (SDK events vs Risk events)
- Event data structures
- Event Bridge (SDK → Risk conversion)
- Risk EventBus (pub/sub system)
- RiskEngine event processing
- Event routing to rules
- Quote event handling ⭐ NEW
- Position polling events
- 8-checkpoint logging system

**Who Should Read This:**
- Developers implementing risk rules
- Developers working on event processing
- Anyone needing to understand event flow

---

### 3. quote-data-integration.md ⭐ NEW
**Document ID:** UNIFIED-SDK-003
**Status:** New Feature Specification

**Purpose:** Real-time quote data for unrealized P&L tracking

**Contents:**
- Quote data sources (SDK QuoteManager, EventBus, SignalR)
- Unrealized P&L calculation formulas
- Contract multipliers (MNQ, ES, NQ, RTY, YM, etc.)
- Quote data flow (real-time + polling)
- Integration with RULE-004 and RULE-005
- Quote event throttling (performance)
- Stale quote detection

**Who Should Read This:**
- Developers implementing RULE-004 (DailyUnrealizedLoss)
- Developers implementing RULE-005 (MaxUnrealizedProfit)
- Anyone working on P&L tracking

**Why This is NEW:**
- Wave 1 & 2 analysis identified quote data as **missing capability**
- Required for accurate unrealized P&L tracking
- Unblocks RULE-004 and RULE-005 implementation

## Reading Order

1. **Start here:** `sdk-integration.md` - Understand SDK components
2. **Then:** `event-handling.md` - Understand event flow
3. **Finally:** `quote-data-integration.md` - Understand quote data (for unrealized P&L)
