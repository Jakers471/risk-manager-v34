**Researcher:** Architecture Specification Unification Specialist
**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Complete

---

## Mission Accomplished

Created unified architecture specifications using **v2 (SDK-first) as the authoritative version**, resolving conflicts between v1 and v2, and incorporating user's daemon architecture guidance.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Resolved v1 vs v2 Conflicts
**Decision:** Use v2 (SDK-first) as authoritative
**Rationale:**
- More mature, modular, production-ready
- SDK-first approach (don't reinvent wheel)
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain and test

**Documented Changes:**
- Enforcement module location
- Event router addition
- Connection manager addition
- Lockout display separation
- Priority handler removal

### 2. Incorporated Daemon Architecture
**User Guidance Applied:**
- System runs as background daemon/service
- Auto-starts on computer startup/login
- Admin configures settings, starts daemon
- Daemon runs continuously monitoring accounts
- Trader cannot stop daemon (UAC protected)
- Admin can stop/restart daemon to load new configs

**New Documentation Created:**
- Complete daemon-lifecycle.md (16 KB)
- Lifecycle stages (setup, operation, reconfiguration, recovery)
- Admin vs Trader separation
- Windows UAC integration
- Startup/shutdown sequences

### 3. Unified Module Specifications
**Consolidated from:**
- Original MOD specs (v2 architecture)
- Wave 1 Architecture Inventory
- Wave 2 State Management Gap Analysis
- Wave 2 Deployment Gap Analysis

**Result:**
- 4 complete module specifications
- Implementation status for each
- Dependencies clearly documented
- Critical path identified
- Testing strategy defined

### 4. SDK Integration Clarity
**Critical Context Documented:**
- Original specs written BEFORE SDK existed
- v1 described manual API integration
- v2 uses Project-X-Py SDK
- Clear SDK vs Risk Manager responsibilities
- What SDK provides vs what we build

## Conflict Resolution Summary

| Aspect | v1 | v2 (ADOPTED) | Resolution |
|--------|----|----|----------|
| **API Integration** | Direct Gateway API | Project-X-Py SDK | Use SDK (v2) |
| **WebSocket** | Manual SignalR | SDK handles SignalR | Use SDK (v2) |
| **Enforcement** | `src/core/enforcement.py` | `src/enforcement/actions.py` | Use v2 structure |
| **Event Routing** | In risk_engine | Dedicated event_router | Use v2 (clearer) |
| **Lockout Display** | In status_screen | Dedicated lockout_display.py | Use v2 (better) |
| **Connection Health** | In signalr_listener | Dedicated connection_manager | Use v2 (SoC) |
| **Priority Handler** | Included | Removed (simplified) | Use v2 (not needed) |

**All conflicts resolved in favor of v2.**

## Implementation Status Documented

### Completed (From Wave 2 Analysis)
- ✅ Database Manager (MOD-001)
- ✅ PnL Tracker

### Missing (Critical Path)
- ❌ Lockout Manager (MOD-002) - Blocks 7 rules (54%)
- ❌ Timer Manager (MOD-003) - Blocks 4 rules
- ❌ Reset Scheduler (MOD-004) - Blocks 5 rules
- ❌ Event Router - Integration point
- ❌ Windows Service Wrapper - Deployment blocker

**Total Estimated Effort:** 5.5 weeks (documented in system-architecture.md)

---

## Critical Path Identified

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
✅ MOD-001 (Database Manager) - Complete

Phase 2: Timer Foundation (Week 2)
❌ MOD-003 (Timer Manager) - Must do first (no dependencies)

Phase 3: Lockout System (Week 3-4)
❌ MOD-002 (Lockout Manager) - Depends on MOD-003, blocks most rules

Phase 4: Daily Reset (Week 4-5)
❌ MOD-004 (Reset Scheduler) - Can parallel with MOD-002

Phase 5: Enforcement Integration (Week 5-6)
❌ Enforcement Actions - SDK integration
```

---

## User Guidance Incorporated

### Daemon Architecture (From User Instructions)
✅ Documented in daemon-lifecycle.md:
- Admin configures via Admin CLI
- Settings locked from trader (UAC protected)
- Admin starts daemon → runs continuously
- Daemon auto-starts on boot/login (no admin needed after setup)
- Monitors accounts, enforces rules, manages lockouts
- Admin can stop/restart to load new configs
- Trader sees status via Trader CLI (read-only)

### Resolution Rule #1 (From User Instructions)
✅ Applied:
- Use v2 (evolved, production-ready, SDK-first)
- Document v1 as historical context
- Follow what Project-X-Py SDK can handle
