# Implementation Foundation

**THE foundation for Risk Manager V34 - Project #34 success**

---

## What This Is

**The NEW foundation** that ties together:
- Analysis (Waves 1-3)
- Specifications (unified specs)
- Implementation (roadmap, guidelines, contracts)
- Testing (TDD, smoke tests, coverage)
- Runtime Validation (8-checkpoints, smoke tests)

**One cohesive system** where everything connects.

## Start Here

**If you're new**:
1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_FOUNDATION.md` ← THE master document
2. Read `/AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` ← How to implement
3. Read `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` ← One-page cheat sheet

**If you're implementing**:
1. Check `/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` ← Pick feature
2. Follow workflow in `IMPLEMENTATION_FOUNDATION.md`
3. Reference `RUNTIME_VALIDATION_INTEGRATION.md` ← Logging
4. Reference `TESTING_INTEGRATION.md` ← Testing

### 1. IMPLEMENTATION_FOUNDATION.md (MASTER)
**What**: Ties EVERYTHING together
**Use**: Complete understanding of system
**Read**: First thing, always

### 2. RUNTIME_VALIDATION_INTEGRATION.md
**What**: Logging + smoke tests MANDATORY
**Use**: After tests pass, validate runtime
**Critical**: Prevents 33-project failure

### 3. TESTING_INTEGRATION.md
**What**: Complete testing workflow
**Use**: TDD, test runner, coverage

## How Foundation Connects to Existing Docs

```
Foundation (docs/foundation/)
    ↓
    ├─> /IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md (what to build)
    ├─> /AGENT_GUIDELINES.md (how to build)
    ├─> /CONTRACTS_REFERENCE.md (interfaces)
    ├─> docs/specifications/unified/ (detailed specs)
    ├─> docs/analysis/wave*/ (context)
    └─> run_tests.py → test_reports/latest.txt (validation)
```

---

## Success Criteria

Foundation succeeds if:
- ✅ Agents find anything in <30 seconds
- ✅ No confusion about workflow
- ✅ Runtime validation is MANDATORY
- ✅ Testing is integrated seamlessly
- ✅ Project #34 succeeds (33 failures prevented)
