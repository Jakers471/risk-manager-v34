**Validates TopstepX authentication and account access**

**What it tests**:
- Environment variables set correctly (API_KEY, USERNAME, ACCOUNT_NAME)
- Can connect to TopstepX API (https://api.topstepx.com)
- Can obtain JWT token from credentials
- Token is valid (not expired)
- Account exists and is accessible
- Account has trading permissions (canTrade = true)

**Result**:
```
[+] Environment variables: OK
[+] SDK available: OK (real project-x-py v3.5.9)
[+] Connected to TopstepX: OK
[+] Account validated: PRAC-V2-126244-84184528

```

**Duration**: ~5 seconds
**Exit Code**: 0 (success)

- Event format matches expectations
- (Note: Uses mock events for testing internal wiring)

**Result**:
```
[+] EventBus initialized: OK

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Import Path Errors
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sanity'`

**Root Cause**: Runner was importing from `sanity.` instead of `src.sanity.`

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# runner.py - Fixed imports
from src.sanity.auth_sanity import AuthSanityCheck
from src.sanity.events_sanity import EventsSanityCheck
from src.sanity.logic_sanity import LogicSanityCheck
from src.sanity.enforcement_sanity import EnforcementSanityCheck
```

**File**: `src/sanity/runner.py:74,88,102,116`

---

### Issue 2: Python Path Not Set
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'risk_manager'`

**Root Cause**: `src/` directory not in Python path

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# runner.py - Added src to path
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent
src_dir = project_root / "src"
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))
sys.path.insert(0, str(src_dir))
```

**File**: `src/sanity/runner.py:20-27`

---

### Issue 3: Environment Variables Not Loaded
**Problem**: `Missing environment variables: PROJECT_X_API_KEY, PROJECT_X_USERNAME, PROJECT_X_ACCOUNT_NAME`

**Root Cause**: `.env` file not loaded before checks

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# runner.py - Load .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # Load before any checks run
```

**File**: `src/sanity/runner.py:18,21`

---

### Issue 4: SDK Contract Access Error
**Problem**: `'InstrumentContext' object has no attribute 'contracts'`

**Root Cause**: Incorrect SDK API usage - trying to access `.contracts` attribute that doesn't exist

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# enforcement_sanity.py - Use hardcoded front month contract
# OLD (incorrect):
contracts = await mnq.contracts.get_active_contracts()
self.contract_id = contracts[0].id

# NEW (correct):
# Use the current front month contract (December 2025)
self.contract_id = "CON.F.US.MNQ.Z25"  # December 2025
```

**File**: `src/sanity/enforcement_sanity.py:68-71`

---

### Issue 5: OrderPlaceResponse Attribute Error
**Problem**: `'OrderPlaceResponse' object has no attribute 'id'` and then `'OrderPlaceResponse' object has no attribute 'get'`

**Root Cause**: Incorrect attribute name - SDK uses camelCase `orderId`, not `id` or `order_id`

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# enforcement_sanity.py - Use correct attribute name
# OLD (incorrect):
self.test_order_id = result.id if hasattr(result, 'id') else result.get('id')

# NEW (correct):
# OrderPlaceResponse has camelCase attribute: orderId
self.test_order_id = result.orderId
```

**File**: `src/sanity/enforcement_sanity.py:91-93`

**SDK Response Format**:
```python
OrderPlaceResponse(
    orderId=1804697601,      # ‚Üê Use this (camelCase)
    success=True,
    errorCode=0,
    errorMessage=None
)
```

  Line 52-55: Sanity check menu items
    [k] Quick sanity (auth + events, ~10s)
    [n] Full sanity (auth + events + logic + enforcement, ~30s)
```

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: From Interactive Menu (Recommended)
```bash
python run_tests.py

# Select option:
[k] - Quick sanity check (auth + events, ~10s)
[n] - Full sanity check (all 4 checks, ~30s)
```

### Option 2: From Command Line
```bash
# Quick check (auth + events only)
python src/sanity/runner.py quick

# Full check (all 4 checks)
python src/sanity/runner.py full

# Individual checks
python src/sanity/runner.py auth
python src/sanity/runner.py events
python src/sanity/runner.py logic
python src/sanity/runner.py enforcement
```

### Option 3: From Python
```python
import asyncio
from src.sanity.runner import SanityRunner

runner = SanityRunner()

# Run full suite
exit_code = asyncio.run(runner.run_full())

# Run quick checks
exit_code = asyncio.run(runner.run_quick())

# Run individual check
exit_code = asyncio.run(runner.run_auth_check())
```

---

## üìä Exit Codes

```
0 = All checks passed ‚úÖ
1 = At least one check failed ‚ùå
2 = Configuration error (missing credentials, etc.)
3 = SDK not available (needs real project-x-py SDK)
```

**Individual Check Exit Codes**:

### Auth Check (0-3)
- `0` = Auth works ‚úÖ
- `1` = Auth failed (invalid credentials) ‚ùå
- `2` = Config error (missing env vars)
- `3` = SDK not available

### Events Check (0-1)
- `0` = Event flow works ‚úÖ
- `1` = Event system broken ‚ùå

### Logic Check (0-3)
- `0` = Rules work with real data ‚úÖ
- `1` = Rules crashed with real data ‚ùå
- `2` = Config error
- `3` = SDK not available

### Enforcement Check (0-3)
- `0` = Can place/cancel orders ‚úÖ
- `1` = Order operations failed ‚ùå
- `2` = Config error
- `3` = SDK not available

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Auth Check Fails (exit code 2):
```bash
# Check .env file exists and has credentials
cat .env | grep PROJECT_X

# Should show:
PROJECT_X_API_KEY=your_key_here
PROJECT_X_USERNAME=your_username
PROJECT_X_ACCOUNT_NAME=your_account
```

### If SDK Not Available (exit code 3):
```bash
# Install real SDK (not mock)
pip install project-x-py

# Verify installation
pip show project-x-py

# Should show:
Name: project-x-py
Version: 3.5.9
```

### If Events Check Fails (exit code 1):
```bash
# Check EventBus implementation
python -c "from risk_manager.core.events import EventBus; print('EventBus OK')"

# Run with verbose output
python src/sanity/runner.py events --verbose
```

### If Logic Check Fails (exit code 1):
```bash
# Check rules can be loaded
python -c "from risk_manager.rules import RuleRegistry; print('Rules OK')"

# Verify SDK connection
python test_connection.py
```

### If Enforcement Check Fails (exit code 1):
```bash
# Check order manager can be imported
python -c "from project_x_py import TradingSuite; print('SDK OK')"

# Test manual order placement
python test_order_placement.py
```

**Testing Pyramid Complete!** You now have full test coverage from unit tests (logic) through sanity checks (live integration) to production readiness. Each layer validates a different aspect:

- **Unit**: Does the code work?
- **Integration**: Do components work together?
- **Smoke**: Does the runtime actually start?
- **Sanity**: Does the live API actually work? ‚Üê This layer!
- **E2E**: Do full scenarios work end-to-end?

With all sanity checks passing, you have high confidence that your risk manager will work in production with the real TopstepX infrastructure!
