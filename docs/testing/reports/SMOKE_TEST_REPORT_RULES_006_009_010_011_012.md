## Special Considerations Handled

### RULE-006 (Frequency)
- ✅ Multiple event generation to trigger cumulative count
- ✅ Rolling window tracking (per_minute, per_hour, per_session)
- ✅ Database mock for trade count tracking
- ✅ Timer manager mock for cooldown enforcement

### RULE-009 (Session)
- ✅ Datetime mocking to simulate outside hours (8 PM)
- ✅ Datetime mocking to simulate weekend (Saturday)
- ✅ Timezone-aware time checking (America/New_York)
- ✅ Next session calculation (skips weekends)

### RULE-010 (Auth Guard)
- ✅ Alert-only behavior verified (enforce is no-op)
- ✅ Connection state tracking validated
- ✅ No position closing (can't close if SDK is down)
- ✅ Alert severity levels (WARNING for disconnect, ERROR for auth)

### RULE-011 (Symbol Blocks)
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Wildcard pattern support (fnmatch)
- ✅ Trade-by-trade enforcement (no lockout)
- ✅ Only blocked position closed, not all positions

### RULE-012 (Trade Management)
- ✅ Long vs short position handling (opposite stop directions)
- ✅ Tick size/value calculations
- ✅ Bracket orders (both stop + target)
- ✅ Trailing stop only moves in favorable direction
- ✅ NOT a violation (it's automation!)

## Conclusion

Successfully built comprehensive smoke tests for 5 diverse risk rules:
- **Frequency tracking** (RULE-006): Multi-event cumulative counting
- **Session enforcement** (RULE-009): Time-based validation with timezone awareness
- **Connection monitoring** (RULE-010): Alert-only behavior (no enforcement)
- **Symbol blacklist** (RULE-011): Trade-by-trade enforcement with wildcards
- **Trade automation** (RULE-012): Helpful automation (not violation/lockout)

All tests pass, all timing requirements met, all special cases handled.

**MISSION COMPLETE! 🚀**

---

## Next Steps

Consider adding:
1. Integration tests with real SDK connection
2. E2E tests with live market data
3. Stress tests (1000+ rapid trades for frequency)
4. Chaos tests (network drops, time zone changes)
5. Performance benchmarks (rule evaluation latency)
