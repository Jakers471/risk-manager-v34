## What Each Test Proves

### RULE-001: Max Contracts

**Proves Runtime Wiring**:
```
✅ Position event → Engine → Rule evaluation
✅ Account-wide position aggregation works
✅ Violation detected (3 > 2)
✅ RULE_VIOLATED event published
✅ ENFORCEMENT_ACTION event published (flatten_all)
✅ Complete flow in 0.00s
```

**Key Validation**:
- Position size calculation across all symbols
- Enforcement action: "flatten_all" (correct)
- No false negatives

---

### RULE-002: Max Contracts Per Instrument

**Proves Runtime Wiring**:
```
✅ Position event → Engine → Rule evaluation
✅ Per-symbol limit checking (MNQ: 2, ES: 1)
✅ Violation detected (MNQ: 3 > 2)
✅ Rule returns True for violation
✅ Complete flow in 0.20s
```

**Key Validation**:
- Symbol-specific limits enforced
- Unknown symbol handling works
- Enforcement: "close_all" or "reduce_to_limit"

---

### RULE-004: Daily Unrealized Loss

**Proves Runtime Wiring**:
```
✅ Position event → Engine → Rule evaluation
✅ Market price retrieved from engine.market_prices
✅ Unrealized P&L calculated correctly
✅ Calculation: (20970 - 21000) / 0.25 * 2 * 5 = -$1200
✅ Loss limit breached (-$1200 < -$200)
✅ RULE_VIOLATED event published
✅ ENFORCEMENT_ACTION event published (close_position)
✅ Symbol: "MNQ" (correct)
✅ Complete flow in 0.00s
```

**Key Validation**:
- Real-time market price integration
- Accurate P&L calculation (tick-based)
- Stop-loss trigger at correct threshold
- Position-specific enforcement (not account-wide)

---

### RULE-005: Max Unrealized Profit

**Proves Runtime Wiring**:
```
✅ Position event → Engine → Rule evaluation
✅ Market price retrieved from engine.market_prices
✅ Unrealized P&L calculated correctly
✅ Calculation: (6010 - 6000) / 0.25 * 1 * 50 = +$2000
✅ Profit target exceeded (+$2000 > +$500)
✅ RULE_VIOLATED event published
✅ ENFORCEMENT_ACTION event published (close_position)
✅ Symbol: "ES" (correct)
✅ Complete flow in 0.01s
```

**Key Validation**:
- Profit calculation (inverse of loss)
- Take-profit trigger at correct threshold
- Position-specific enforcement
- Works for different contracts (ES vs MNQ)

---

### BONUS: Multi-Rule Test

**Proves Runtime Wiring**:
```
✅ All 4 rules coexist in same engine
✅ Engine evaluates all rules on each event
✅ Non-violating scenario: 0 violations (no false positives)
✅ Rules don't conflict with each other
✅ Performance: 0.22s for 4 rules
✅ System handles multiple rules efficiently
```

**Key Validation**:
- Multi-rule support works
- No interference between rules
- Correct independent evaluation
- Scalable architecture

## Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue 1: Unicode Encoding ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Emoji characters (✅) caused UnicodeEncodeError on Windows
```python
# Before (fails on Windows)
print(f"✅ RULE-001 fired")

# After (works everywhere)
print(f"[OK] RULE-001 fired")
```

### Issue 2: Missing Pytest Marker ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `@pytest.mark.smoke` not registered
```toml
# Before
markers = [
    "unit: Unit tests",
    "integration: Integration tests",
]

# After
markers = [
    "unit: Unit tests",
    "integration: Integration tests",
    "smoke: Smoke tests - runtime wiring validation",  # Added
]
```

## Test Pyramid Integration

The smoke tests now fit into the testing pyramid:

```
        /\
       /E2E\        10% - Full system with real SDK
      /------\
     / Smoke  \     5% - Runtime wiring validation ⭐ NEW
    /----------\
   /  Integ     \   30% - Component interaction
  /--------------\
 / Unit Tests     \ 55% - Fast, isolated logic
/------------------\
```

**Smoke Tests Bridge the Gap**:
- Unit tests: Prove logic works in isolation
- Smoke tests: Prove wiring works in runtime ⭐
- Integration tests: Prove components work together
- E2E tests: Prove system works end-to-end

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ **DONE**: Position-based rules smoke tests
2. 🔄 **TODO**: P&L-based rules smoke tests (RULE-003, RULE-007)
3. 🔄 **TODO**: Trade-based rules smoke tests (RULE-006, RULE-008, RULE-012)
4. 🔄 **TODO**: Restriction rules smoke tests (RULE-009, RULE-010, RULE-011)

### Long-Term
1. Integrate smoke tests into CI/CD pipeline
2. Run smoke tests before every deployment
3. Add smoke tests to "gate" test suite
4. Monitor smoke test performance over time

---

## Key Learnings

### What Works Well
1. **Async/Await**: asyncio handling is solid
2. **Event Bus**: Event propagation works perfectly
3. **Rule Architecture**: Rules evaluate independently
4. **Performance**: All tests <1s (excellent)
5. **Mocking**: AsyncMock for SDK works great

### What to Watch
1. **Windows Encoding**: Avoid emojis in print statements
2. **Pytest Markers**: Register all custom markers
3. **Timeout Handling**: 10s is generous (could reduce to 5s)
4. **State Management**: Clear state between tests

### Best Practices Established
1. Use `@pytest.mark.smoke` for all smoke tests
2. Test one complete flow per rule
3. Track timing and assert <10s
4. Verify 3 events: input → violation → enforcement
5. Mock SDK, use real EventBus/Engine
6. Print success message with timing

---

## Conclusion

**Mission: ACCOMPLISHED ✅**

All 4 position-based rules have comprehensive smoke tests that prove:

1. ✅ **Events reach rules** - Complete event flow validated
2. ✅ **Manager calls rules** - Engine integration verified
3. ✅ **Violations trigger enforcement** - Action execution confirmed
4. ✅ **All within time limit** - <1s (99% faster than 10s requirement)

**Exit Code**: 0 (Success)
**Tests**: 5/5 passing (100%)
**Performance**: Excellent (0.51s total)
**Coverage**: 4/12 rules (33%)

The smoke test suite provides **confidence that position-based rules actually fire in runtime**, not just pass unit tests.
