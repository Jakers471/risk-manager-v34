FILES TO KEEP (2 CORE + 1 AI REFERENCE)
----------------------------------------

1. KEEP: docs/current/TESTING_GUIDE.md
   Reason: Best entry point for human developers
   Purpose: Quick start, basic patterns, pytest commands
   Audience: Developers new to the project

2. KEEP: docs/TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
   Reason: Most comprehensive step-by-step TDD workflow
   Purpose: Detailed TDD process, SDK comparisons, mistake avoidance
   Audience: Developers implementing features
   Action: ADD integration testing sections from RUNTIME_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md

3. KEEP: docs/AI_ASSISTED_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md
   Reason: Unique AI agent orchestration content
   Purpose: Guide for AI agents reading documentation
   Audience: AI assistants working on the project
   Action: Reference the 2 core docs instead of duplicating content


FILES TO DELETE (2)
-------------------

1. DELETE: docs/TESTING_METHODOLOGY_ANALYSIS.md
   Reason: 80% redundant with TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
   Action: Migrate "Recommended Adoptions" section to TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
   Lines to preserve: 809-1033 (adoption roadmap)

2. DELETE: docs/RUNTIME_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md
   Reason: Core concepts overlap with TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
   Action: Migrate "Critical Path Testing" and "Smoke Tests" to TDD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md
   Lines to preserve: 350-505, 799-987, 1128-1193
