# Agent 3 Delivery: Logging & Display System with 8-Checkpoint Visibility

## Mission Complete ✅

Agent 3 has successfully built a comprehensive logging and display system with full 8-checkpoint visibility for the Risk Manager V34.

---

## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Core Logging System (`src/risk_manager/cli/logger.py`)

**Dual logging system with console and file output:**

- **Console logging**: Human-readable, color-coded, INFO level by default
- **File logging**: Detailed DEBUG level, includes PID, structured format
- **Windows UTF-8 support**: Handles emoji rendering on Windows console
- **Rotating logs**: Daily rotation, 30-day retention, ZIP compression
- **Thread-safe**: Uses enqueue for concurrent logging

**Key Functions:**
```python
setup_logging(console_level="INFO", file_level="DEBUG", log_file=None, colorize=True)
log_checkpoint(checkpoint_num, message=None, details=None, level="info")
log_event_received(event_type, event_data=None)
log_rule_evaluated(rule_name, passed, details=None)
log_enforcement_triggered(action, rule_name, details=None)
log_system_status(status, details=None)
log_success(message)
log_error(message, exc_info=True)
log_warning(message)
checkpoint(num, msg=None, **kwargs)  # Shorthand
```

### 2. Display System (`src/risk_manager/cli/display.py`)

**Rich event display with color-coded output:**

**Key Features:**
- Event type-specific color coding (cyan for positions, yellow for orders, green for trades, red for violations)
- Real-time event streaming with formatted output
- Rule evaluation display with pass/fail indicators
- Enforcement action display with severity levels
- P&L updates with profit/loss color coding
- Position and rule status summaries
- Startup/shutdown banners

**Display Modes:**
- `log` mode: Streaming logs (default, fully implemented)
- `dashboard` mode: Live dashboard (placeholder for future Rich-based UI)

**Key Functions:**
```python
EventDisplay(mode="log")
display.show_event(event)
display.show_rule_check(rule_name, passed, current_value, limit, details)
display.show_enforcement(action, rule_name, symbol, details)
display.show_pnl_update(realized, unrealized, total, symbol)
display.show_position_summary(positions)
display.show_rules_status(rules)
display.show_startup_banner()
display.show_shutdown_banner()
```

### 3. Checkpoint Utilities (`src/risk_manager/cli/checkpoints.py`)

**Convenient wrappers for each of the 8 checkpoints:**

```python
checkpoint_service_start(details=None)                    # CP1: 🚀 Service Start
checkpoint_config_loaded(rules_count, instruments)        # CP2: ✅ Config Loaded
checkpoint_sdk_connected(instruments, account_id)         # CP3: ✅ SDK Connected
checkpoint_rules_initialized(rules, rules_count)          # CP4: ✅ Rules Initialized
checkpoint_event_loop_running(rules_count)                # CP5: ✅ Event Loop Running
checkpoint_event_received(event_type, symbol, details)    # CP6: 📨 Event Received
checkpoint_rule_evaluated(rule_name, passed, current, limit)  # CP7: 🔍 Rule Evaluated
checkpoint_enforcement_triggered(action, rule_name, details)  # CP8: ⚠️ Enforcement Triggered
```

**Shorthand aliases:**
```python
cp1(), cp2(), cp3(), cp4(), cp5(), cp6(), cp7(), cp8()
```

## 🔧 How Agent 2 Should Use This

### Import the Functions

```python
from risk_manager.cli import (
    checkpoint_rule_evaluated,
    checkpoint_enforcement_triggered,
)
```

### Add to Rule's `evaluate()` Method

```python
async def evaluate(self, event: RiskEvent, engine: "RiskEngine") -> dict | None:
    # Your existing rule logic
    current_loss = self._calculate_daily_realized_loss(engine)
    violated = current_loss < self.limit

    # ADD: Log checkpoint 7
    checkpoint_rule_evaluated(
        rule_name=self.name,
        passed=not violated,
        current_value=current_loss,
        limit=self.limit,
    )

    if violated:
        violation = { ... }

        # ADD: Log checkpoint 8
        checkpoint_enforcement_triggered(
            action=self.action,
            rule_name=self.name,
            details={"loss": current_loss, "limit": self.limit},
        )

        return violation

    return None
```

**That's it!** Two function calls and your rule will have full checkpoint visibility.

## 🔍 How to Verify This Delivery

### 1. Run the Example

```bash
cd C:\Users\jakers\Desktop\risk-manager-v34
python examples/logging_display_example.py
```

**Expected**: All 8 checkpoints log with emojis and colors.

### 2. Check the Log File

```bash
cat data/logs/example.log
```

**Expected**: Structured logs with PID, timestamps, and checkpoints.

### 3. Import the Modules

```python
from risk_manager.cli import (
    setup_logging,
    EventDisplay,
    checkpoint_service_start,
    cp1, cp2, cp3, cp4, cp5, cp6, cp7, cp8,
)
```

**Expected**: All imports succeed, no errors.

### 4. Read the Integration Guide

```bash
cat AGENT2_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
```

**Expected**: Clear instructions for integrating CP7 and CP8.

---

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Emoji Checkpoint Markers**
- **Why**: Visual scanning of logs is critical during debugging
- **Benefit**: Can instantly spot "where did it stop?" (last emoji = last checkpoint)

### 2. **Dual Logging (Console + File)**
- **Why**: Different audiences (developer vs operations)
- **Benefit**: Console for realtime, file for post-mortem analysis

### 3. **Structured Metadata (key=value)**
- **Why**: Easy to parse programmatically
- **Benefit**: Can grep for specific values, build metrics

### 4. **Separate Checkpoint Module**
- **Why**: Convenience wrappers reduce boilerplate
- **Benefit**: `cp7(...)` is easier than `log_checkpoint(7, ...)`

### 5. **Color-Coded by Event Type**
- **Why**: Differentiate event streams at a glance
- **Benefit**: Spot anomalies faster (red in a sea of green)

### 6. **Windows UTF-8 Handling**
- **Why**: Windows console defaults to cp1252, breaks emojis
- **Benefit**: Emojis work out of the box on Windows

## 🎓 What Agent 2 Needs to Know

### Integration Points

**You only need to touch TWO places:**

1. **After evaluating your rule** (pass or fail):
   ```python
   checkpoint_rule_evaluated(rule_name, passed, current_value, limit)
   ```

2. **When building a violation dict** (before returning it):
   ```python
   checkpoint_enforcement_triggered(action, rule_name, details)
   ```

**That's it!** Everything else is already wired up in the core system.

### Log Output Location

- **Console**: Realtime, color-coded, INFO level
- **File**: `data/logs/risk_manager.log`, DEBUG level, rotates daily

### Testing Your Integration

```python
# In your test
from risk_manager.cli import setup_logging

setup_logging(console_level="DEBUG")  # See all logs in tests

# Run your test, check for checkpoint logs
# Look for: 🔍 [CHECKPOINT 7] and ⚠️ [CHECKPOINT 8]
```
