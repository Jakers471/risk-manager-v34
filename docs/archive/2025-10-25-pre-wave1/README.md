# Pre-Wave 1 Documentation Archive

**Archived:** October 25, 2025
**Reason:** Superseded by Wave 1 Feature Discovery Analysis

---

## What's in This Archive

This archive contains all documentation that existed **before Wave 1 Feature Discovery**. These documents have been analyzed, consolidated, and their findings are now in:

**üìä Current Source of Truth:** `/docs/analysis/wave1-feature-inventory/`

## Archive Organization

### 01-specifications/
**Original:** `docs/PROJECT_DOCS/`

**Contents:**
- Original project specifications (pre-SDK era)
- 12 risk rule specifications
- ProjectX Gateway API documentation (30+ endpoints)
- System architecture (v1 and v2)
- Module specifications (enforcement, lockout, timer, reset)
- Project overview and summaries

**Status:** Analyzed in Wave 1, findings in:
- `01-RISK-RULES-INVENTORY.md`
- `02-SDK-INTEGRATION-INVENTORY.md`
- `03-ARCHITECTURE-INVENTORY.md`

**Note:** These specs were written BEFORE Project-X SDK existed. They describe manual API integration. Current implementation is SDK-first, but these specs are valuable for understanding design intent and edge cases.

---

### 02-status-tracking/
**Original:** `docs/current/`, `docs/implementation/`, `docs/progress/`

**Contents:**
- Project status documents
- Implementation plans
- Progress tracking
- SDK integration guides
- Security model
- Configuration formats
- Multi-symbol support
- Rule categories and mappings

**Status:** Analyzed in Wave 1, findings in:
- `06-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS-INVENTORY.md`
- `05-SECURITY-CONFIG-INVENTORY.md`
- `02-SDK-INTEGRATION-INVENTORY.md`

**Note:** Current status is now tracked in Wave 1 reports. These docs show the evolution of the project over time.

---

### 03-testing-docs/
**Original:** `docs/testing/`

**Contents:**
- Testing methodology guide
- Runtime debugging documentation
- Working with AI workflows
- Testing navigation

**Status:** Analyzed in Wave 1, findings in:
- `04-TESTING-INVENTORY.md`

**Note:** These docs have been consolidated and improved. The Wave 1 analysis is now the authoritative testing reference.

---

### 04-developer-guides/
**Original:** `docs/dev-guides/`

**Contents:**
- Quick reference guides
- Implementation summaries
- Security quick reference

**Status:** Analyzed in Wave 1, findings in:
- `07-DEVELOPER-EXPERIENCE-INVENTORY.md`
- `08-TECHNICAL-REFERENCE-INVENTORY.md`

**Note:** Developer experience is now comprehensively documented in Wave 1. Use those reports for current guidance.

## Why Archive?

### Before Wave 1:
- ‚ùå Multiple versions of specs (v1, v2, current, old)
- ‚ùå Conflicting information across docs
- ‚ùå Unclear which docs were authoritative
- ‚ùå Hard to find specific features
- ‚ùå ~200+ markdown files to search through

### After Wave 1:
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth (11 inventory reports)
- ‚úÖ All conflicts identified and resolved
- ‚úÖ Every feature catalogued with source references
- ‚úÖ Clear version matrix (old vs new)
- ‚úÖ Easy navigation by category

## How to Use This Archive

### If You Need to Reference Original Specs:

1. **Check Wave 1 First:** `/docs/analysis/wave1-feature-inventory/00-WAVE1-SUMMARY.md`
2. **Find the Category:** Use the appropriate inventory report (01-08)
3. **Trace to Source:** Each finding includes file path and line numbers
4. **Read Original if Needed:** Come to this archive for full original context
