# Archived Documentation - 2025-10-23 Sessions

**These are OLD documents from previous sessions.**

## What's Here

This archive contains documentation created during the initial project setup sessions on 2025-10-23. These documents have been **replaced** by newer, better-organized documentation.

### Archived Files

1. **CURRENT_STATE.md** - Old project status (replaced by `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md`)
2. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Old file tree (merged into PROJECT_STATUS.md)
3. **ROADMAP.md** - Old implementation plan (merged into PROJECT_STATUS.md)
4. **SESSION_RESUME.md** - Old resume guide (replaced by `CLAUDE.md` + PROJECT_STATUS.md)

## Why Archived?

These docs were created before we:
- Established proper folder structure
- Created comprehensive SDK integration guide
- Set up TDD infrastructure
- Understood the SDK-first approach clearly
