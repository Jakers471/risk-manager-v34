PATH TO PRODUCTION
==================

Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1 hour) MUST DO
- Create config/timers_config.yaml (30 min, template provided)

Phase 2: Test Fixes (1-2 hours) RECOMMENDED
- Fix lockout persistence (1 hour)
- Fix bool iteration bug (30 min)
- Result: 99.7% -> 100% tests passing ✅

Phase 3: Live Validation (30 min) STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
- Execute real trades (MNQ, ENQ, ES)
- Verify all rules fire correctly
- Check P&L calculations
- Result: Production confidence ✅

Phase 4: Windows Service (4-6 hours) OPTIONAL
- Service wrapper for auto-start
- UAC-based admin protection
- Crash recovery
- Result: Production deployment ready ✅

TOTAL TIME: 3-4 hours to production-ready ✅
