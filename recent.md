C:\Users\jakers\Desktop\risk-manager-v34\recent1.md - makrte is closed so i cant take any positions right now, but seeing the current project structure, configs, src, lockout/scheudles, enforcment, rules etc... i just want to make sure      
were headed in the right direction. so right no wwe have 9 rules enabled. all 9 rules, soon to be 13, they are attached to scheudles, timers, resets. every rule needs to handle every event, so event comes in, events get checked by rules,      
determined if breched or not, then lockout/state are supposed to set dedicated enforcment logic based on the rule breach severity. some dont have lockout/timers/resets etc. but it should also be known, that if a timer etc is breached and      
activated, all othe rrisk rules dont need to check rules untill its done. lockouts/timers/resets create a kind of prioritized enforcment logic. DO WE AND DO THE DOCS REFELCT THIS KIND OF ARCITECHTURE? 

● Great architectural question! Let me investigate whether the current system design properly reflects this priority-based enforcement model where active lockouts should block other rule evaluation.

  This is a critical insight you're highlighting:
  - 🔴 Active lockout = Don't waste cycles checking other rules
  - 🎯 Lockouts/timers create enforcement hierarchy
  - ⚡ Some rules might not have lockouts at all

  Let me check the docs and code to see if this architecture is actually implemented:

● Read(AI_HANDOFF_TIMERS_CONFIG.md)
  ⎿  Read 539 lines

● Read(HONEST_PROJECT_STATUS.md)
  ⎿  Read 419 lines

● Read(FORWARD_ROADMAP.md)
  ⎿  Read 762 lines

● Read(docs\current\PROJECT_STATUS.md)
  ⎿  Read 1405 lines

● Excellent architectural question! You've identified a critical enforcement hierarchy that could save significant CPU cycles and prevent rule conflicts. Let me investigate whether the current architecture actually implements this
  priority-based system.

● Read(src\risk_manager\core\engine.py)
  ⎿  Read 409 lines

● Search(pattern: "is_locked_out|check_lockout|lockout.*active", path: "src\risk_manager", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 10 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check the enforcement and rule structure to see if there's any priority-based logic:

● Read(src\risk_manager\rules\daily_realized_loss.py)
  ⎿  Read 180 lines

● Search(pattern: "class.*Rule.*evaluate", path: "src\risk_manager\rules")

● Let me check one more critical piece - the documentation around enforcement architecture:

● Search(pattern: "priority|hierarchy|lockout.*before|short.?circuit", path: "docs", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 600 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can give you a comprehensive architectural assessment:

  🎯 Architectural Gap Identified: NO Priority-Based Lockout Enforcement

  You've spotted a critical architectural issue. Here's what I found:

  ---
  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────

  Current Architecture vs. Your Vision

  What You Want (Priority-Based Enforcement):
  Event arrives → Check global lockout FIRST → If locked: STOP ALL RULES
                                            → If not locked: Evaluate rules

  What Actually Exists:
  Event arrives → Engine loops through ALL rules → Each rule individually checks lockout
                                                → Wasted CPU cycles on every rule

  The Problem: No centralized lockout gate. Every rule must remember to check is_locked_out() individually, and ALL rules execute even when the account is already locked.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ---
  Current Implementation Analysis

  From engine.py:67-111 (evaluate_rules method):
  async def evaluate_rules(self, event: RiskEvent) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
      violations = []

      # ❌ NO lockout check here!
      for rule in self.rules:
          violation = await rule.evaluate(event, self)  # Every rule runs
          # ...

  From daily_realized_loss.py:159-162:
  # Each rule checks individually
  if self.lockout_manager.is_locked_out(account_id):
      logger.debug(f"Account {account_id} already locked, skipping evaluation")
      return None

  Problems with this approach:
  1. ❌ CPU waste: All 9 rules execute their evaluate() methods even when account is locked
  2. ❌ Fragile: Every rule must remember to check lockout state
  3. ❌ No hierarchy: Lockouts don't actually prevent other rules from running
  4. ❌ 9 database/memory lookups per event instead of 1 centralized check

  ---
  Documentation Reveals Original Intent

  I found this gem in docs/analysis/wave3-audits/06-architecture-consistency-audit.md:597:

  Impact: Without Event Router, lockout enforcement cannot work as designed. When implemented, MOD-002 (Lockout Manager) will need Event Router to check lockouts before routing events to rules.

  This means someone DID design the priority-based system you're describing, but it was never implemented!

  ---
  What the Architecture SHOULD Look Like

  # engine.py (PROPOSED FIX)
  async def evaluate_rules(self, event: RiskEvent) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
      """Evaluate all rules against an event."""

      # Extract account_id from event
      account_id = event.data.get("account_id")

      # ✅ CENTRALIZED LOCKOUT CHECK (Priority enforcement!)
      if account_id and self.lockout_manager.is_locked_out(account_id):
          logger.info(f"🔒 Account {account_id} locked - skipping all rule evaluation")
          return []  # Short-circuit: Don't waste cycles

      # Only evaluate rules if NOT locked out
      violations = []
      for rule in self.rules:
          violation = await rule.evaluate(event, self)
          # ... rest of logic

  Benefits:
  - ✅ 1 lockout check per event instead of 9
  - ✅ CPU savings: Rules don't execute when locked
  - ✅ Clear hierarchy: Lockouts take precedence over all other rules
  - ✅ Simpler rules: Rules no longer need to check lockout state individually

  ---
  Configuration & State Implications

  Your insight is correct:
  "if a timer etc is breached and activated, all other risk rules don't need to check rules until it's done"

  This creates a 3-tier enforcement hierarchy:

  Tier 1: Active Lockout (STOP EVERYTHING)
    └─ Hard lockout active? → Block all rule evaluation

  Tier 2: Timer/Cooldown (CONDITIONAL BLOCKING)
    └─ Cooldown timer active? → Block certain actions

  Tier 3: Normal Rules (EVALUATE AS USUAL)
    └─ No lockout/timer? → Check all rules

  Current timers_config.yaml supports this conceptually:
  - Hard lockouts (until_reset, until_session_start)
  - Timer cooldowns (60s, 15m, 1h)
  - But the enforcement engine doesn't respect this hierarchy

  ---
  Does This Architecture Exist in Docs?

  Short answer: NO, not explicitly documented.

  I searched for:
  - priority, hierarchy, lockout.*before, short.?circuit

  What I found:
  - ✅ Rule priority tiers mentioned in QUICK_STATUS.md (Priority 1, 2, 3 rules)
  - ✅ Original design intent found in architecture audit (check lockouts before routing)
  - ❌ NO documentation of the actual priority-based enforcement flow
  - ❌ NO architecture diagrams showing lockout gate pattern

  The docs focus on:
  - EventRouter extraction (event handling architecture)
  - Individual rule implementations
  - State management (lockouts, timers, resets)
  - But NOT the centralized enforcement hierarchy you're describing

  ---
  Recommendation: Implement Priority-Based Enforcement

  Phase 1: Centralize Lockout Check (30 minutes)
  # src/risk_manager/core/engine.py
  async def evaluate_rules(self, event: RiskEvent) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
      # Add centralized lockout check
      account_id = event.data.get("account_id")
      if account_id and self.lockout_manager.is_locked_out(account_id):
          return []  # Short-circuit

      # Continue with normal rule evaluation...

  Phase 2: Remove Individual Checks (15 minutes)
  - Remove is_locked_out() checks from rules (daily_realized_loss, daily_realized_profit, etc.)
  - They're now redundant with centralized check

  Phase 3: Add Tier 2 (Timer/Cooldown Logic) (1 hour)
  - Some rules might want to run even during cooldowns (monitoring rules)
  - Add rule attribute: respects_lockouts = True/False
  - Refine centralized check to allow monitoring rules through

  Phase 4: Document Architecture (30 minutes)
  - Create docs/current/ENFORCEMENT_HIERARCHY.md
  - Diagram showing 3-tier enforcement
  - Update architecture docs to reflect this pattern

  ---
  Summary

  Your architectural insight is 100% correct:
  - ✅ Lockouts/timers SHOULD create priority-based enforcement
  - ✅ Active lockouts SHOULD block all other rule evaluation
  - ❌ Current implementation does NOT do this (each rule checks individually)
  - ❌ Docs do NOT reflect this architecture

  This is a real architectural gap that should be fixed before production deployment.

  Would you like me to implement the centralized lockout check? It's a quick fix with significant benefits (CPU efficiency + clearer architecture).
  ⎿  Stop hook error

> WELL, IF ONE RULE IS LOCKED OUT (ON A TIMER/SCHEDULE) ESENTIALLY NO OTHER RULES NEED OT BE ACTIVE YEA, THAT RULE HOLDS PRECEDENCE, AND WHILE THAT TIMER/SCHEUDLE IS STILL ACTIVE AND RUNNING, ENFORCMENT IS LOCKED DOWN/ACCOUNT WIDE CLOSE       
ALL POSITIONS/FLATTEN. SO IF DAILY REALISED LOSS/PROFIT IS HIT, ITS PUT ON A SCHEUDLE, RESET AT 5PM (NOT HARDCODED CAN CONFIGURE THIS), THAT MEANS FOR 24 HOURS OR WHATVER, THAT ENFORCMENT IS LOCKED IN, SO ALL POSITIONS TAKEN WILL BE CLOSED    
 AUTO AS FAST AS POSSIBLE NO EXCEPTIONS. 

● OH! You're describing something MUCH more critical than I initially understood! This is a continuous enforcement lockout, not just skipping rule evaluation. Let me make sure I have this right:

  ---
  🚨 CRITICAL: Continuous Enforcement During Lockout

  What You're Describing (The Real Requirement):

  Daily loss limit hit at 11:00 AM → Lockout until 5:00 PM reset

  11:00 AM: RULE-003 triggers → Flatten all positions → Set lockout
  11:01 AM: Trader somehow opens new position → IMMEDIATE AUTO-CLOSE (no questions asked)
  11:02 AM: Another position opens → IMMEDIATE AUTO-CLOSE
  ... (continuous enforcement for 6 hours)
  5:00 PM: Daily reset → Lockout expires → Normal trading resumes

  Key Requirements:
  1. ✅ One-time enforcement: Close all positions when rule triggers
  2. ✅ Continuous enforcement: ANY new position opened during lockout = instant auto-close
  3. ✅ Account-wide protection: No bypass, no exceptions, no trading
  4. ✅ Schedule-based unlock: Stays locked until timer expires (5PM or configured time)

  ---
  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────

  This Is a "Kill Switch" Pattern

  When a lockout rule triggers (daily loss, daily profit, session hours), it's not just recording state - it's actively preventing all trading until unlock.

  Real-World Analogy:
  - Nuclear reactor SCRAM button → Shuts down ALL systems
  - Fire alarm → Locks ALL doors until reset by fire department
  - Circuit breaker → Cuts ALL power until manually reset

  In our system:
  - Daily loss limit → Closes ALL positions + blocks ALL new trades until 5PM
  - This prevents trader from "revenge trading" or bypassing the system
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Current Architecture Analysis: DOES IT SUPPORT THIS?

  Let me trace through what happens today when a lockout is set...

● Read(src\risk_manager\core\engine.py)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines

● Search(pattern: "flatten.*all|close.*all.*position", path: "src\risk_manager", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 19 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now let me check what happens when a new position opens DURING an active lockout:

● Read(src\risk_manager\rules\daily_realized_loss.py)
  ⎿  Read 20 lines

> IT DEPENDS ON THE SCHEUDLE/TIMER THO... LIKE TRADE FREQUENCY IS MUCH SHORTER FOR EXAMPLE 

● AH! You just clarified a critical distinction! Let me revise:

  ---
  🎯 Two Types of Lockouts (Different Enforcement Behavior)

  Type 1: Soft Lockout (Cooldowns) - Block New Trades Only

  Example: Trade Frequency Limit (RULE-006)
  - Cooldown: 60 seconds after 3 trades in 1 minute
  - Enforcement: Block new orders for 60 seconds
  - Existing positions: Leave them alone
  - If somehow new position opens: Let it go (trader's problem)

  11:00:00 - Trade 1, 2, 3 → Cooldown starts (60s)
  11:00:05 - Try to open trade 4 → BLOCKED
  11:00:30 - Try to open trade 5 → BLOCKED
  11:01:00 - Cooldown expires → Normal trading resumes

  ---
  Type 2: Hard Lockout (Kill Switch) - Continuous Enforcement

  Example: Daily Realized Loss (RULE-003)
  - Lockout: Until 5PM daily reset
  - Enforcement: Flatten all positions + block all new trades
  - Existing positions: Closed immediately
  - If somehow new position opens: AUTO-CLOSE IMMEDIATELY (no exceptions)

  11:00 AM - Daily loss -$500 hit → Hard lockout until 5PM
  11:00 AM - Flatten all positions
  11:15 AM - Position somehow opens → IMMEDIATE AUTO-CLOSE
  12:00 PM - Another position opens → IMMEDIATE AUTO-CLOSE
  ... (continuous enforcement for 6 hours)
  5:00 PM - Daily reset → Lockout expires

  ---
  Current Architecture: MISSING Hard Lockout Continuous Enforcement

  What happens TODAY if position opens during hard lockout:

  11:00 AM: RULE-003 triggers
           └─ Set lockout in database ✅
           └─ Flatten all positions ✅

  11:15 AM: New POSITION_OPENED event arrives
           └─ Engine calls evaluate_rules()
           └─ RULE-003 checks is_locked_out() → TRUE
           └─ RULE-003 returns None (skips evaluation)
           └─ NO violation returned
           └─ Position stays open! ❌ BUG!

  The continuous enforcement loop is MISSING!

  ---
  Solution: Add "Lockout Guard" in Event Pipeline

  We need to add centralized logic that intercepts events BEFORE rule evaluation:

  # src/risk_manager/core/engine.py
  async def evaluate_rules(self, event: RiskEvent) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
      """Evaluate all rules against an event."""

      account_id = event.data.get("account_id")

      # ✅ NEW: Lockout Guard (Continuous Enforcement)
      if account_id and self.lockout_manager.is_locked_out(account_id):
          lockout_info = self.lockout_manager.get_lockout_info(account_id)
          lockout_type = lockout_info.get("type")  # "hard_lockout" or "cooldown"

          # HARD LOCKOUT: Continuous enforcement (kill switch)
          if lockout_type == "hard_lockout":
              # If ANY position exists or opens, flatten immediately
              if event.event_type in [EventType.POSITION_OPENED, EventType.POSITION_UPDATED]:
                  logger.critical(
                      f"🚨 HARD LOCKOUT ACTIVE - Auto-closing position "
                      f"(reason: {lockout_info['reason']})"
                  )
                  await self.flatten_all_positions()
                  return []  # Don't evaluate rules

          # COOLDOWN: Just block new orders (soft lockout)
          elif lockout_type == "cooldown":
              if event.event_type in [EventType.ORDER_SUBMITTED]:
                  logger.warning(
                      f"⏱️ COOLDOWN ACTIVE - Blocking new order "
                      f"(remaining: {lockout_info['remaining_time']}s)"
                  )
                  return []  # Don't evaluate rules

          # Either way, skip rule evaluation during lockout
          logger.info(f"🔒 Account {account_id} locked - skipping rule evaluation")
          return []

      # Normal rule evaluation continues...
      violations = []
      for rule in self.rules:
          # ...

  ---
  Configuration: How to Distinguish Hard vs. Soft Lockouts

  In config/timers_config.yaml:

  lockout_durations:
    hard_lockout:  # Type 2: Kill switch (continuous enforcement)
      daily_realized_loss: "until_reset"      # Hard lockout until 5PM
      daily_realized_profit: "until_reset"    # Hard lockout until 5PM
      session_block_outside: "until_session_start"  # Hard lockout until 8:30 AM
      auth_loss_guard: "until_reset"          # Hard lockout until manual reset

    timer_cooldown:  # Type 1: Soft lockout (block new trades only)
      trade_frequency:
        per_minute_breach: "60s"              # Cooldown 60s
        per_hour_breach: "30m"                # Cooldown 30min
        per_session_breach: "1h"              # Cooldown 1h
      cooldown_after_loss: "15m"              # Cooldown 15min

  The key is the lockout type stored in the lockout_manager:
  - type: "hard_lockout" → Continuous enforcement (auto-close any new positions)
  - type: "cooldown" → Block new orders only (let existing positions ride)

  ---
  Does This Architecture Exist Today?

  Let me check the lockout_manager schema:

● Search(pattern: "set_lockout|set_cooldown|type.*lockout|type.*cooldown", path: "src\risk_manager\state\lockout_manager.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 149 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

> AND SOME DONT HAVE TIMERS/SCHEUDLES (TRADE-BY TRADE) 

● PERFECT! Now I understand the complete picture. You have THREE enforcement patterns:

  ---
  🎯 Complete Enforcement Architecture (3 Patterns)

  Type 1: Trade-by-Trade (No Lockout/Timer)

  Example: RULE-002 (Max Contracts Per Instrument)
  Limit: 2 contracts per symbol

  10:00 AM - Open 2 MNQ contracts → OK ✅
  10:05 AM - Try to open 3rd MNQ contract → Position opens ✅
  10:05 AM - Rule detects excess → Close 1 contract (reduce to 2) ✅
  10:06 AM - Try to open another MNQ → Position opens ✅
  10:06 AM - Rule detects excess → Close 1 contract again ✅

  Characteristics:
  - ✅ No lockout state
  - ✅ No timer/schedule
  - ✅ Each event handled independently
  - ✅ Trader can immediately try again

  ---
  Type 2: Soft Lockout (Cooldown Timer)

  Example: RULE-006 (Trade Frequency Limit)
  Limit: 3 trades per minute

  10:00:00 - Trade 1 ✅
  10:00:15 - Trade 2 ✅
  10:00:30 - Trade 3 ✅
  10:00:31 - Cooldown triggered → 60 second timer starts

  10:00:45 - Try to trade 4 → BLOCKED ❌ (cooldown active)
  10:01:15 - Try to trade 5 → BLOCKED ❌ (cooldown active)
  10:01:31 - Cooldown expires → Trading resumes ✅

  Characteristics:
  - ✅ Lockout state: type: "cooldown"
  - ✅ Short timer: 60s, 15min, 1h
  - ✅ Block NEW trades only
  - ✅ Existing positions OK (no auto-close)

  ---
  Type 3: Hard Lockout (Kill Switch + Schedule)

  Example: RULE-003 (Daily Realized Loss)
  Limit: -$500 daily loss

  11:00 AM - Daily loss hits -$500
           → Flatten all positions immediately ✅
           → Set hard lockout until 5:00 PM (daily reset) ✅

  11:15 AM - Position somehow opens (bug/race/SDK issue)
           → IMMEDIATE AUTO-CLOSE ❌ (no exceptions!)

  12:30 PM - Another position opens
           → IMMEDIATE AUTO-CLOSE ❌ (no exceptions!)

  ... (continuous enforcement for 6 hours)

  5:00 PM - Daily reset → Lockout expires → Normal trading ✅

  Characteristics:
  - ✅ Lockout state: type: "hard_lockout"
  - ✅ Long schedule: Until reset (5PM, 8:30AM, etc.)
  - ✅ Block NEW trades
  - ✅ Continuous enforcement: Any new position = auto-close
  - ✅ Account-wide protection (no bypass)

  ---
  Current Implementation: Infrastructure Exists ✅, Logic Missing ❌

  From lockout_manager.py, the types ALREADY exist:
  # Line 165: Hard lockout
  self.lockout_state[account_id] = {
      "type": "hard_lockout",  # ✅ Infrastructure ready!
      # ...
  }

  # Line 223: Cooldown
  self.lockout_state[account_id] = {
      "type": "cooldown",  # ✅ Infrastructure ready!
      # ...
  }

  BUT the engine.py doesn't use this information!

  Current engine.py:67-111:
  async def evaluate_rules(self, event: RiskEvent):
      # ❌ NO lockout check here!
      # ❌ NO distinction between hard_lockout vs cooldown
      # ❌ NO continuous enforcement for hard lockouts

      for rule in self.rules:
          violation = await rule.evaluate(event, self)  # All rules run every time

  Result:
  - ✅ Type 1 (trade-by-trade) works: Rules evaluate every event
  - ✅ Type 2 (cooldown) works: Rules check is_locked_out() individually
  - ❌ Type 3 (hard lockout) BROKEN: No continuous enforcement!

  Configuration Mapping: Which Rules Use Which Pattern?

  From your 9 enabled rules:

  Type 1: Trade-by-Trade (No Lockout)
  - RULE-002: Max Contracts Per Instrument → Close excess, no lockout
  - RULE-004: Daily Unrealized Loss → Close position, no lockout
  - RULE-005: Max Unrealized Profit → Close position, no lockout

  Type 2: Soft Lockout (Cooldown)
  - RULE-006: Trade Frequency Limit → Cooldown (60s, 30m, 1h)
  - RULE-007: Cooldown After Loss → Cooldown (15m tiered)

  Type 3: Hard Lockout (Kill Switch)
  - RULE-003: Daily Realized Loss → Hard lockout until 5PM ⚠️
  - RULE-013: Daily Realized Profit → Hard lockout until 5PM ⚠️
  - RULE-009: Session Block Outside → Hard lockout until session start ⚠️
  - RULE-010: Auth Loss Guard → Hard lockout until reset ⚠️

  ⚠️ = Requires continuous enforcement (currently missing!)

  Summary: What Needs to Be Fixed

  | Pattern                | Infrastructure         | Engine Logic                | Status  |
  |------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
  | Type 1: Trade-by-Trade | ✅ Rules work           | ✅ Works                     | WORKING |
  | Type 2: Soft Lockout   | ✅ type: "cooldown"     | ✅ Rules check lockout       | WORKING |
  | Type 3: Hard Lockout   | ✅ type: "hard_lockout" | ❌ No continuous enforcement | BROKEN  |

  The fix:
  1. Add lockout guard to engine.py (1-2 hours)
  2. Distinguish hard_lockout vs cooldown behavior
  3. For hard_lockout: Auto-flatten any position that opens
  4. Test with live SDK to verify continuous enforcement

  This is CRITICAL for production - without it, traders can bypass hard lockouts by opening new positions during the lockout period!

  Should I implement this fix now?

● YES! You're making sure I have the complete picture. Let me create a comprehensive architectural summary with all three patterns clearly documented:

> ALSO SOMETHING REALISED/UNREALISED HAVE TO CONNECT SOMEHOW. IF REALISED IS SET TO LIMIT OF -/+ 900, IF I TAKE 4 TRADES, AND UNREALISED IS SET TP +/- 200, AND IF I HIT +200 ON ALL, THAT = +800, WHICH MEAN NEXT TADE I TAKE, IF IM UP OR        
DOWN 200 MORE THAT PUTS ME OVER THE +/- 900, SO THEORETUCALY UNREALISED SHOULD KNOW TO CLOSE AT +/- 100 REGARDLESS IF THE UNREALISE DGAIN LOSS RULES HAVENT HIT THEIR LIMIT, BECAUSE THE UNREALSIED TOOK THE "REALISED" OVER ITS THRESHOLD.
