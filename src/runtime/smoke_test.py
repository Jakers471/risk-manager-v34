"""
Smoke test for risk manager system boot validation.

Boots the system, waits for first event or timeout, validates all critical
components are properly wired and operational.

Exit codes:
- 0: Success - system booted and first event received
- 1: Exception - critical error during boot
- 2: Stalled - timeout waiting for first event

Environment variables:
- BOOT_TIMEOUT_S: Timeout in seconds (default: 8)
