# Documentation Structure Reference

This file documents the organization of all markdown files in this project.

## Root Level (Keep Minimal)
- README.md          - Project overview (ALWAYS CURRENT)
- STATUS.md          - Current status and issues (ALWAYS CURRENT)
- .docs-structure    - This file (reference only)

## docs/ Directory (All Other Docs)
- INDEX.md                              - Main navigation hub
- summary_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md              - Project snapshots
- implementation/plan_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md  - Implementation roadmaps
- progress/phase_X_complete_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md - Milestone docs
- PROJECT_DOCS/                         - v2 architecture specifications

## Naming Convention
All dated documents: {name}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md

Examples:
- summary_2025-10-23.md
- plan_2025-10-23.md
- phase_2-1_complete_2025-10-23.md

## What Goes Where?

### Root Level
- ONLY: README.md, STATUS.md
- WHY: Quick access to essential info

### docs/
- EVERYTHING ELSE
- WHY: Organized, versioned, navigable

### docs/implementation/
- Implementation plans and roadmaps
- Technical design docs

### docs/progress/
- Completed milestone documentation
- Phase completion summaries

### docs/PROJECT_DOCS/
- Reference architecture (from v1 project)
- Rule specifications
- Module specifications

## For AI Assistants

When creating new docs:
1. Check if it's essential → Root (README or STATUS only)
2. Everything else → docs/ with date suffix
3. Update docs/INDEX.md with new doc
4. Use relative links

## For Developers

Start here: README.md → docs/INDEX.md → Follow links

## Archive Policy

Old docs are kept with [ARCHIVED] prefix:
- [ARCHIVED]_plan_2025-10-15.md

This preserves history without confusion.
