# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Entry Point

**READ THIS FIRST** - Every session starts here

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Adaptable Documentation

**This file uses REFERENCES, not hard-coded structures.**

- ‚ùå **DON'T** rely on cached file trees or progress percentages
- ‚úÖ **DO** use paths and check actual files for current state
- ‚úÖ **DO** use `ls`, `find`, `pytest --collect-only` to see structure
- ‚úÖ **DO** read `docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for latest progress

**Reason**: Hard-coded structures go stale immediately. Always check the actual files.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This file tells Claude AI exactly what to read and in what order to get up to speed on this project.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Project**: Risk Manager V34
**Environment**: WSL2 Ubuntu (`~/risk-manager-v34-wsl`)

---

## üìñ Quick Start (First 2 Minutes)

### 1. Read These Files IN ORDER:

```
1. docs/current/PROJECT_STATUS.md          (2 min) - Current state & progress
2. docs/current/SDK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md   (3 min) - How we use Project-X SDK
3. docs/dev-guides/QUICK_REFERENCE.md      (1 min) - Commands & common tasks
```

**After reading these 3 files, you will know**:
- ‚úÖ What's been built (25% complete)
- ‚úÖ What the SDK handles for us
- ‚úÖ What we still need to build
- ‚úÖ Exactly where we left off
- ‚úÖ What to do next

---

## üîë Key Understanding #1: SDK-First Approach

### CRITICAL CONTEXT

**The specs in `docs/PROJECT_DOCS/` were written BEFORE the Project-X SDK existed.**

At that time:
- We had to map everything to raw ProjectX Gateway API
- Manual WebSocket handling
- Manual state tracking
- Manual order/position management

**NOW we have the Project-X-Py SDK** which handles:
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connections (SignalR)
- ‚úÖ Real-time events (positions, orders, trades)
- ‚úÖ Order management (place, cancel, modify)
- ‚úÖ Position management (close, partially close)
- ‚úÖ Account data & statistics
- ‚úÖ Market data & indicators
- ‚úÖ Auto-reconnection

### What This Means

**DON'T**: Reimplement what the SDK already does
**DO**: Use the SDK as foundation, add risk management on top

**Example**:
- ‚ùå OLD: Write custom SignalR listener from specs
- ‚úÖ NEW: Use `TradingSuite` from SDK, wrap with risk logic

See `docs/current/SDK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for mapping.

## üîê Key Understanding #2: Windows UAC Security

### CRITICAL: NO CUSTOM PASSWORDS

**The system uses Windows UAC (User Account Control) for admin protection.**

**NO custom passwords stored. NO authentication database. Just Windows admin rights.**

### Why This Matters

The Risk Manager is designed to be **"virtually unkillable"** by the trader:

- ‚úÖ Windows Service runs as LocalSystem (highest privilege)
- ‚úÖ Trader CANNOT kill the service without Windows admin password
- ‚úÖ Trader CANNOT edit configs (protected by Windows ACL)
- ‚úÖ Trader CANNOT stop the service via Task Manager
- ‚úÖ Admin CLI requires Windows elevation (UAC prompt)
- ‚úÖ Only Windows admin password can override protection

**This is NOT a custom password system. This is OS-level security.**

### Two Access Levels

```
Admin CLI:  Right-click terminal ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"
            ‚Üí Windows UAC prompt ‚Üí Enter Windows admin password
            ‚Üí Full control (configure, unlock, stop service)

Trader CLI: Normal terminal (no elevation needed)
            ‚Üí View-only access
            ‚Üí See status, P&L, lockouts, logs
            ‚Üí CANNOT modify anything
```

**See `docs/current/SECURITY_MODEL.md` for complete details.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notes

### Architecture Clarification

**Original Specs** (`docs/PROJECT_DOCS/`):
- Written before Project-X SDK existed
- Describe manual API integration
- Direct WebSocket handling
- Custom state management

**Current Implementation** (V34):
- **SDK-First**: Project-X-Py handles heavy lifting
- **Risk Layer**: We add risk management on top
- **Async**: Modern async/await throughout
- **Event-Driven**: SDK events ‚Üí Risk rules ‚Üí Enforcement

### Key Decision
**Don't reimplement what SDK provides. Use SDK, add risk logic.**

---

## üß™ Test-Driven Development

**We use TDD** - Tests written first, then implementation.

**Test Structure**: See `tests/` directory
- Use `pytest --collect-only` to see all available tests
- Use `ls -R tests/` to see current test structure

**Workflow**:
1. Write test first (it fails - RED)
2. Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor (REFACTOR)
4. Repeat
